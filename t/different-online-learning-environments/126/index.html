<blockquote><p>The LMS is Moodle so teachers can build in chat times and discussion forums.  I actually teach two sections of Middlebury Latin.  VTVLC is really excellent for supporting students in mastery learning if they fall off the pacing chart.</p></blockquote></aside>
<p><span class="mention">@karenbudde</span>,</p>
<p>Well, paint my thoughts a priori and call them a posteriori! You teach Latin using Moodle? How cool is that!</p>
<p>Moodle is one of my favorite environments. As an undergrad, I managed to annoy a couple professors with a tendency I had for a duration where I made Moodle a topic of focus in assignments at every opportunity. Undergrad psych class assignment? No problem! Explore the topic of research psychology for educational technology design so I can plug my favorite OER. Undergrad finance class assignment? No problem! Talk about costs of implementation and maintenance for educational IT so I can go on about my preferred poison of proficiency pursuit.</p>
<p>There are a lot of really cool modules for Moodle out there to help enhance features. I have to say they do a great job with chats and discussion forums. I bet VTVLC gets every drop of best use out of it all. </p>
<p>I keep trying to get over to the Annual Moodle Research Conference but I have a lot going on that time of the year. The first was held in Crete-Greece a couple years ago and looked like it was extremely fun, informative, and all-around productive. I've lost track since but I imagine they still host it in Greece.</p>
<p>You may see more and more of the effects of those conferences as time goes by, especially with a large cooperative that seems to stay updated as VTVLC. The Moodle Research Conferences have always placed a high focus on posters and presentations addressing accessibility and interoperability. Things may only get easier and better with Moodle, especially when working alongside other technologies.</p>
<p>It's good to hear VTVLC helps students with pacing issues. One of the biggest takeaways I got out of my short experience with the Montessori method as a child is how critical it can be in how a learner's pace is addressed and encouraged.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how lively a thread just about Moodle will be. I'm probably one of their biggest, loudest, most annoying fans. I also like other learning environments, though.</p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite online learning environment?</p>
<p>Have you had experience with Moodle or special Moodle modules?</p>
<p>What are important features and functions that you feel an all-inclusive online learning environment should have?</p>

<p>My only other experiences were with Brainhoney and Middlebury Interactive.  I do not tend to pick favorites.  I do not know about special Moodle modules.  I need to go to a conference but Greece might be too far.  </p>
<p>I think the quick feedback from assignments and quizzes is critical.  The discussion forums and chats for collaboration a must.  You?</p>

<p>I should probably take your lead and strive not to pick favorites, either. I really can't even explain why I like Moodle so much. It might have something to do with the fact that it was the first online environment I got to tinker around with using my own install. That actually probably has a lot to do with it, now that I think about it. But I am generally influenced to like any environment that has a big database of add-on modules and modifications by community. VTVLC might already use some custom stuff from the community database with their Moodle.</p>
<p>I like that stuff, I also like easy embed features and video chats. I think there's a lot to think about on assessment end and a lot to think about on interface end. I especially like versatility in grading options such as sliding scale.</p>
<p>I've seen some other environments that have a lot of things in common. I have never tried either of those, thanks for pointing me to them.</p>
<p>Also, I probably should say that LCL is definitely a favorite. It's very true, and I don't want to come off as unappreciative of what going on here. However, we haven't really used full environments for LCL like we are talking about, so far it has been a combination of tools and resources with more specialized functions (Discourse for forums, YouTube for live video chats, etc).</p>
