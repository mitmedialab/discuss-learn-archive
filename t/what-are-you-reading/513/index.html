<p>New to this Forum of Educators,<br/>I have been excited by recent sessions experienced at the NAIS conference in Orlando, FL. I met the starters of EdCamp, and felt the buzz in the room generated by everyone harnessing technology in the classroom to energize both teachers and students alike. I attended a session by Milton Chen and I am reading his book titled Education Nation. The candidates in the room shared as much as they could by just chatting. What we are learning from each other is the way we can find leadership. It is not coming from any one source. I am finding Twitter posts a fantastic source from Edutopia, BrainPickings and more. It's a joy to learn with thousands of educators and know that we are not confined to our four walls. It is time to go beyond!</p>

<p>I'm not reading it yet, but it's been sitting on my desk making me feel guilty for months because I know it's a deep read but I really need to crack this puppy open.  It's called <strong><em>Getting to Maybe: How the World is Changed</em></strong>, by Westley, Zimmerman &amp; Patton.  It's about making the impossible happen.</p>

<p>My recent journey into this way of teaching started with Turtles, Termites and Traffic Jams by the fearless leader of this course. Then everything just snowballed. Here is a <a href="http://www.middleschoolminecraft.com/library/" rel="nofollow">link</a> to some great books that have inspired me in the past year or so.

<p>James, this book looks fascinating and important. I hope to read it as well. As a "grown-up" I feel I have the power to let go of technology and "be" with people. I worry about my own kids and my students not being to disconnect. We had a student have his phone taken away for a week or two. I asked how it was for him expecting him to say how he did so many other things. Instead he described how he felt it vibrating in his pocket even thought it wasn't there. Like a phantom limb! Crazy. Here is a <a href="http://www.middleschoolminecraft.com/2012/07/22/balance/#more-637" rel="nofollow">post</a> I wrote about technology and balance some time ago. </p>
