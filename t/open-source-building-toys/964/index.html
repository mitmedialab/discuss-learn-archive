<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I created an open-source building toy last year. <a href="http://tintoy.posthaven.com" rel="nofollow">http://tintoy.posthaven.com</a> The files to print the hubs of the building toy are available on Thingiverse here: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:166730" rel="nofollow">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:166730</a> As some of you may have seen in a post for week 4, I've also been messing around with another somewhat related idea for a really simple building toy: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:301989" rel="nofollow">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:301989</a></p>
<p>Last Saturday I had a booth at the Westport Mini Maker Faire in which I was primarily presenting my explorations creating light sculptures. <a href="http://bartels.posthaven.com/building-bigger-light-sculptures-by-going-modular" rel="nofollow">http://bartels.posthaven.com/building-bigger-light-sculptures-by-going-modular</a> I took along a small set of the building toy hubs in case anyone happened to be interested, as I've been using the pieces in some of my recent work. <br/><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" data-download-href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/uploads/default/ab8aca3881d2b6a248510dba192a5d61e6b9b5ce" href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/uploads/default/477/42b15e08dcc36473.jpg" title="IMG_1168.jpg"><img height="500" src="../../../images/e64d95df96_375x500.jpg" width="375"/><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">IMG_1168.jpg</span><span class="informations">720x960 477 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div> </p>
<p>I had the building toy pieces in a box off to the side and a number of times during the day kids noticed the pieces and started playing with them, quickly getting the hang of how they work. I regretted not having brought a bigger set of the pieces because it was really interesting watching how the kids were interacting with them. To the kids' parents I did a lot of explaining how I wanted to have an open-source building toy available for schools and families who might want to print and mod a building toy free of any copyright issues.</p>
<p>If any of you have access to a 3D printer, and could print some of these for kids to play with, it would be great to see what the kids create.</p>
<p>The only thing you need besides the 3D printed parts are nuts, bolts and wood dowels. Metal nuts and bolts work great. I mostly use nylon instead because it is lighter. I use 8/32 threaded rod with matching regular and/or wing nuts. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FMUZ4Y/ref=biss_dp_t_asn" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FMUZ4Y/ref=biss_dp_t_asn</a></p>
<p>Anyway, hope some of you might be interested in playing with this project.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Fred</p>
