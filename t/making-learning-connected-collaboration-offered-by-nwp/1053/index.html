<p>Our good friends at NWP are offering their CL MOOC (connected learning mooc) again. Here is the announcement. </p>
<hr/>
<p>As part of The Summer to Make, Play &amp; Connect, the second annual Making Learning Connected collaboration (also known as #clmooc), will kick off June 13, 2014. We invite you and your community to take part -- signups are now open:</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="http://clmooc.educatorinnovator.org/2014/" target="_blank">http://clmooc.educatorinnovator.org/2014/</a></p>
<p>Making Learning Connected (#clmooc) is a collaborative, knowledge-building and sharing experience through Educator Innovator open to anyone interested in making, playing, and learning together about the educational framework known as <a href="http://blog.nwp.org/educatorinnovator/connected-learning/">Connected Learning.</a></p>
<p>As an open learning event organized as iterative cycles, #clmooc provides educators of all types -- both in and out of school, across grades and disciplines -- with opportunities to play with new tools, make projects and friends, and share their makes and reflections with colleagues across the country and around the world.</p>
<p>The 2014 event will run from June 13–August 1. It will be organized in weekly cycles that will allow you to come and go or stay to participate in all the cycles. This open design is intentional and we hope that everyone will feel comfortable customizing the experience to their own needs and activities.</p>
<p>Want to join us this summer? Please sign up to receive advance information in mid-May.</p>
<p>Want to connect your open learning opportunity with ours? We’d love to hear your ideas or talk to you about any opportunities.</p>
<p>Want to share Making Learning Connected with your community? Please do! Please point folks to the website Making Learning Connected (http://clmooc.educatorinnovator.org/2014/) and to <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=#clmooc&amp;src=typd">#clmooc on Twitter.</a></p>
