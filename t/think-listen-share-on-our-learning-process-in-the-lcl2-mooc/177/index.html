<p>With three others (at times that accommodate international participants), we're planning hangout events in which we will think, listen, and share about the state of our learning in the LCL2 MOOC.<br/>The first week (March 18-20) we will pay special attention to a "Prepare" step valuable for subsequent participation in the MOOC -- or for deciding not to participate this time around.  Participants will discuss what type of learning experience we are looking for; what we could put in place to minimize the barriers or challenges; and so on.  The hangout will support us to take the time to address these and related questions.<br/>In following 6 weeks, as long as people keep joining the sessions, there will be similar hangouts about the state of our learning, paying special attention each week to 6 more steps of MOOC involvement: Orient, Declare, Network, Cluster, Focus, Reflect.  (The sequence here combines 5 steps identified by Dave Cormier -- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8avYQ5ZqM0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8avYQ5ZqM0</a> with pre- and post- steps added by Felicia Sullivan, <a href="http://bit.ly/moocsteps" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/moocsteps</a> .)<br/>The hangout hosts are return LCL participants, whose experience in LCL 2013 led to collabex.wikispaces.com, which addresses the needs of online learners who want to dig deeper, make “thicker” connections with other learners, and connect topics with their own interests.  <br/>Hangout times during the week: Tues 7.30am, Weds 4pm, Thurs 9am &amp; 8pm.  Note: The USA will be on summer time.

<p>I am using the hangout time today (April 15) to follow up on posts from people who have connected with me around think-listen-share, meta-MOOCing, and improving learning in LCL.  (Indeed, re: Cormier's network &amp; cluster phases of MOOC participation, a group has formed that hangouts at a different time.)  I am going to skip hosting a live session at this time (7.30am EST USA) in weeks 6 &amp; 7 and instead use my not-unlimited energies to do the Focus and Reflect through private writings and posts or asynchronous exchanges or other live hangouts.  Reflect will include formulating revised approaches in light of the limited "catch" of participants that these think-listen-share sessions have had in LCL2.</p>
