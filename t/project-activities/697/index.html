<p>I am very much a beginner, but thought it’d be fun to make a logic puzzle sort of introduction (even though me posting it actually makes it illogical).  <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19826127/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19826127/</a></p>
<p>Then I had fun with stacking blocks to play code in two ways.  When I was growing up, we’d play games around the campfire.  One ‘code’ game had us watching another person give clues to a word with a stick through various motions and taps on the ground.  If you knew they were scratching out the consonants (and you had to keep in mind they might appear upside down or sideways depending on where you were observing), that was helpful.  If you knew the number of taps corresponded to a vowel, a=1, e=2 and so on, you appeared brilliant to those who didn’t know the “keys.” <br/><a class="onebox" href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19836596/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19836596/</a></p>

<p><span class="mention">@dogtrax</span> This really ties in with some of what the group talked about in the videos. Scratch is one of my favorite coding tools. But it is a tool, a means to an end. Some projects have better tools for the individual's needs and personal interests. There are other visual-based coding environments like Scratch out there. The learner may do better with a tool that has nothing to do with programming, even if most of the rest of the class is interested in Scratch for their projects. I think it is important to encourage participants to try out a simple introduction to different types of tools and maybe even try simple projects like this week's activity to get an idea of how they might be able to explore it, but when it is time to work on personal projects and focus on individual interests it is good to consider when a learner wants to shelf one tool and pick up a different one.</p>

<p>Thank you Sandy. The best part using Lists are probably that you can import a txt file direct into the list with rightclick. It's easier to write the dialog in Notepad or something.</p>
<p>If you make music, one list could contain notes and one the duration, and then combine the two into music...</p>
<p>I'm glad I inspired you making Lists. <img alt="smile_cat" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/smile_cat.png" title=":smile_cat:" width="64"/> </p>

<p>Here's my intro project for Week 2: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19598241/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19598241/</a>  It's a maze game that you have to navigate.  Behind the numbers you'll either find an unhappy face or you'll find out some info about me.  There is a pattern on which numbers have the info about me, but you'll have to figure it out.  The game keeps track of the number of lives you have and your score.  </p>
<p>I was really keen on learning how to do the score and lives aspect of the game (using variables).  Luckily I have a resident programming expert -- my 12 year old son <img alt="smiley" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/smiley.png" title=":smiley:" width="64"/>  There is a lot about the code that I don't fully understand, but I think with more practice I'll get it.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to change is how my project is displayed -- it shows the final screen instead of the maze.  If anyone has tips on how to change this, please let me know!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>Claire</p>

<p>Hi I'm Vivian.  I'm late to join the forums, though I've been following the course from the start. I've been hanging about the Twitter hashtag #lcltalk </p>
<p>Week 1: I wrote about the Learning Spiral and did our assignment <a href="http://www.coetail.com/chezvivian/2014/03/22/creativelearning/" rel="nofollow">here</a> in this blogpost.<br/>Week 2: You'll find my Scratch Project embedded on this blogpost: "<a href="http://www.coetail.com/chezvivian/2014/03/29/scratchprojects/" rel="nofollow">Scratch that Low Floor but High Ceiling</a>" I also wrote quite a bit comparing the puzzles-type of "learn to code" programs with "create" types of programs like Scratch. I was completely in agreement (from my personal experiences) with views mentioned in video 3 about the differences between Puzzles &amp; Projects (Creation).</p>

<p>I just posted my first ever Scratch project here: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19895114/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19895114/</a></p>
<p>It's called "The Art of Scratching and Creative Life Lessons."  I think of myself more as an artist than a tech person, so I tried to find a way to join the two.  </p>
<p>What I found most interesting about the process was how the elements I wanted to create drove what I learned.  That is, as I came up with ideas of what I wanted to add, I then dove in and played with the program to figure out how to get it to work.  I really felt a powerful sense of intrinsic motivation and interest-driven learning in action.</p>
<p>I hope what I created isn't too far afield from what Scratch is all about.  Thanks for a fun exercise!</p>

<p>Wow. I had WAY to much fun thinking and reflecting about this experience. Here's my feeble attempt: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20060986/#fullscreen" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20060986/#fullscreen</a></p>
<p>As I did this,  I was reminded of learning LOGO in the first grade. I could spend hours and hours just playing and building. I experienced similar frustrations (and satisfactions) of setting out to accomplish something with my "turtle" and trying to figure out how to make it happen! It felt good, but it also reminded me that we need to give ourselves time to just play. It also reminded me how frustrating it can be to want to express/do something but not know "the code." I think this has strong implications for ELL learners. Just TOL here.. <img alt="wink" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/wink.png" title=":wink:" width="64"/></p>

<p>Check out my introduction project here: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20057525/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20057525/</a></p>
<p>Building this project taught me a lot about my own learning style. For one, I need to be more patient with myself as I learn new skills. It's easy to get frustrated when you run into barriers, but working through them and solving the problem is rewarding.</p>
<p>Since I'm so new to computer programming, it took a lot of trial and error to figure out the Scratch tools as well as how to bring my ideas to life. Looking at other projects for inspiration and tips was very helpful. I look forwarding to playing around with Scratch more in the future.</p>

<p>I made a remix of it with the event added of "When flag clicked" and it worked fine from there. Love the message - I am working in a new school where we are trying an innovative look at secondary schooling. Even with pick of staff from all over NZ, some of what we are trying is uncomfortable and challenging for teachers!</p>

<p>Interesting insight on the Puzzle-type activities. Here is a <a href="https://vimeo.com/16927761" rel="nofollow">short video</a> you may be interested in viewing, <span class="mention">@mresmres</span>  discusses how Scratch can make variables become meaningful and motivating for the students.  I believe this may be taken from his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mitch_resnick_let_s_teach_kids_to_code" rel="nofollow">Ted Talk</a>.  I have found in my teaching with my students, that Scratch ignites a passion in them. It so exciting to see them wanting to learn and they just can't seem to get enough. They want to create and they see the need to learn the different concepts to bring their visions to life.  </p>

<p>One of the great things about Scratch is that we can all look at the code itself and see how it is supposed to work! I second Skola, put a "When Flag Clicked" hat at the top of your code and this will work perfectly.</p>

<p>I had a great time doing this. It was an iterative process and I just kept getting ideas on how I wanted to do it. At one point, I wanted to just copy the script but it wouldn't let me, so I just Googled my question and a link come up that told me about the backpack feature that made it so much easier. I really enjoyed this process. </p>

<p>Philipp (1L2P),<br/>Okay, first of all Seymour's car was really old, so it didn't take that much damage to total it. <br/>Second, he loaned it to me to run an errand in winter. <br/>Third, it wasn't my fault. A gentleman ran a stop sign and rammed me from the side. He wasn't going very fast because, as he pointed out, he had halted at the stop sign and then proceeded from his side street into the snow-packed intersection. Apparently he didn't notice I was on the main street with the right of way. Neither of us could stop in the slick snow, but I still feel bad about it.</p>

<p>I agree with you about the intrinsic motivation.  You said:<br/>the elements I wanted to create drove what I learned<br/>I couldn't agree with you more and I think this really is a wonderful strength of Scratch.  Tied in with this is the idea of the "low floor" (easy to get started) and "high ceiling" (able to get very complex) of Scratch.</p>

<p>I wanted to share a Scratch story. I created my first Scratch project during the first LCL course which can be found here <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3127789/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3127789/</a> . Last week, my brother told me that my nieces, ages 8 &amp; 10, love Scratch. He said, my niece Jenny's dream is to visit the MIT Media Lab. I told them I could show them a video tour by Mitch who created Scratch and they were extremely excited. We watched the video together and they loved it, especially (like me) the silk worm installation in the lobby. Then we shared our Scratch projects. I was so impressed with both of their work and their very clear understanding of remixing. They showed me that they had just created a Chicken Lovers Group and invited me to join. Then they created a Family group for the Scratchers in our family <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/383951/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/383951/</a>.  You can check out their work, Lily, age 8, memowpie <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/memowpie/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/users/memowpie/</a>  and Jenny, age 10, PokemonWarriorCats <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/PokemonWarriorCats/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/users/PokemonWarriorCats/</a> </p>

<p>You remind me so much of a professor I know who actually works in Theoretical computer science, but told me, "You know, given a choice I'd do maths clubs and science clubs for high school students all day". As young people who had just finished their Ph.D he often travelled with a group to rural India to "take science to the villages". There was this one time when they were in a village near Kanchipuram to hold a sky show, in May, when Jupiter is easily spotted in the Indian skies. After setting up the telescope and making general announcements about the time of the sky show, they just hung around the village, chatting. At 8 p.m, they were surprised to see that over 50 people had turned up for the sky show, half of whom were children who were running everywhere, accidentally moving the accurately set up telescope, pointed at Jupiter. The crowd was getting impatient and annoyed at every minor adjustment that had to be made, and every extra minute they had to queue up for so that they could look at Jupiter, while half of them did not know what the fuss about that tiny speck was. Somebody then had a brainwave to point the telescope at the moon. The moon is an important part of growing up in India, often used to distract babies into eating. Being something that everyone easily identified with and being a large object that can be easily focussed upon, the simple idea of pointing the telscope at the moon turned the entire event into a huge hit with children running under the starlit sky saying, "Nila kaataraanga, nila kaataraanga"(They're showing the moon, they're showing the moon!").</p>

<p>Despite teaching Scratch every year to my fourth graders, I rarely take the time to work on a Scratch project myself. This was an activity that forced me to "get my hands dirty" with Scratch and I had a great time using backgrounds, voice, sprites and animation to make my story. This also helped my teaching this week because I was able to show my students how background changes can help keep the momentum going in a story or animation. They also thought that the cutout of me and my giant hand looked pretty funny up on the screen.

<p>Thanks for the video.  Yes, this is helpful.  It would be great to see more material linking Scratch to learning objectives.  I know they are there, but for a teacher that doesn't know Scratch, it's not clear what they are and how to use Scratch to address them.  I'm sure there are resources out there.  I just have to dig in and look for them. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Everyone.</p>
<p>I know this comes quite late but if anyone is a bit behind like myself here is my SCRATCH project. <br/>I learned a ton doing this but it took me quite some time. This is likely because I am stubborn, and because I insisted on designing my own Spite which ate up a good chunk of time. </p>
<p>I am having a few issues with the coding in particular in relation to timing of my sprites. I am also having difficultly with the very last bit of code. I wanted to get my sprite to wave. I created 4 sprite each with the hand in a different position and then put in 4 commands for costume changes and wrapped them in a repeat - but it's not working. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>I am hoping to be able to integrate Scratch into my art practice as I move more towards video work. </p>

<p>Hi Sandra,<br/>Great first Scratch project.  The problem  you are having with your wave at the end is that you are not using a wait block between costume switches.  Here a screenshot of a fix you may want to try.  I took the first costume out of the loop, as I thought it looked more realistic without that costume.<br/> <img height="221" src="../../../images/970302dcda60f6c7.png" width="209"/> </p>

<p>I'm a little late, but I got so engrossed in creating my first Scratch project and spent quite a bit of time doing it! I really enjoyed it. It's not very advanced, but does have quite a few different sprites and scenes. I mostly used changes in back drop colours as events. I am sure there are more elegant ways of doing some of the things that I did, but still need to play around a bit more to do this!</p>
<p>Here's my scratch project: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20054468/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20054468/</a></p>
<p>Instead of introducing myself, I decided to introduce 4 kids who are quite special to me, called the Thunderbolt Kids! These 4 kids come from the original project called <a href="http://www.kusasa.org/" rel="nofollow">Kusasa</a>, developed in Cape town, South Africa. It's an educational resource aimaed at developing analytical and critical thinking skills, using role models, stories, computer modelling, experiments and lesson plans.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.siyavula.com" rel="nofollow">Siyavula</a>, we obtained the Thunderbolt Kids from the Shuttleworth Foundation and used the 4 kids as guides in our Gr 4-6 openly licensed content for Natural Sciences and Technology, which you can view here: <a href="http://www.thunderboltkids.co.za" rel="nofollow">www.thunderboltkids.co.za</a>. This was the content that I developed in 2012, and why I got to know these 4 kids so well <img alt="smile" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/smile.png" title=":smile:" width="64"/></p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" data-download-href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/uploads/default/1fc0f51e2af553b508f15266c3913bafb45e0108" href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/uploads/default/367/0b249a5c5d95a84e.png" title="Gr 4 cover.png"><img height="500" src="../../../images/aa67222299_352x500.png" width="352"/><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">Gr 4 cover.png</span><span class="informations">832x1180 600 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div> <br/>The original Kusasa material is based on Squeak, but we would like to rework it in the future to rather use Scratch and serve it as an online course. I think before, many teachers did not find it that easy to implement and use the Kusasa material using an an offline LMS that was quite complex. I would like to integrate the projects with what learners are covering in class in Science and Technology, so that although it is extra curricular, kids willbe learning creative thinking skills, which has links to hwat they are doing in class during the day.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this, I decided to use this opportunity to make a Scratch project to introduce these 4 characters. Have fun!</p>

<p>Thanks Philip! Yes, I knew you were also a fellow, but wasn't sure when. I'm working at Siyavula now with Mark, doing all the Gr 4-9 content.  We have revived the Thunderbolt Kids as Kusasa was such a great project. Doing this course has inspired me to relook at all the Kusasa resources that we have and what we can do with them, and I was actually just chatting to one of our directors yesterday (after I showed him my Scratch project :)) about developing a curriculum for Gr 4-9. I think it could be quite exciting.</p>

<p>Yes please, that would be great! I joined the peer discussion topic on "Tech curriculum" too to get some ideas. But, I am not too sure where to start! My feeling is that we would want to develop a course for kids, but which provides a lot of support to educators in South Africa. Otherwise I think they would feel quite over whelmed and would just stick to the traditional curriculum. Then, as they grow in experience and confidence, they can start adapting the course, also allowing kids to guide what they want to do, as has been suggested before. These are just my initial thoughts. But, what I really need is some guidance on the types of projects and tools that educators are using with kids in this age group, and how to scaffold it through the years. So, if I could get some insight or suggestions from other educators that would be really helpful. My email is megan@siyavula.com. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I played with the scratch this morning using the logo from my website and my banner. My logo is a character so I made that my sprite. I tried out a few features to introduce myself.</p>

<p>lot of fun making this  project!! <br/>I found out that in the process of building this project I first choose the picture for the stages and the look of the sprites, only after this step I started to managing the the "timing" variable..it was a challenge to me and took so much time and so much tests ..maybe it's because I'm not so "expert" using scratch. Surelly in the next project I'll pay more attention to that in an earlier step.</p>

<p>I had a lot fun playing with this tool for the first time. I feel like there's so much more Scratch can do, but time was limited! I also felt that it was a bit more challenging to figure out then I anticipated. I thought having some development experience would make it easier, but in some ways it became more challenging to figure out how the development instructions translate in this program. </p>

<p>In Mindstorm Papert make a comparison between learnig to code and learning a new language...maybe as in learning any language, it's better not try to translate?? <img alt="wink" class="emoji" height="20" src="../../../images/wink.png" title=":wink:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Here is my about me project: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37143246/" rel="nofollow" title="about me">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37143246/</a>. I have tinkered with the code before, it's fun to return to the project because I have learned more about Scratch since the last time I worked on it. </p>
<p>From this week's readings/videos, I really enjoyed Mitch and Nataile's discussion of projects. Mitch's observation that constructionism "It isn't just about constructing things, but constructing things you care about, experimenting, trying new things" was a statement that really stuck with me. In my own development as a teacher, I find myself working to develop project prompts that get closer to my students' interests and curiosity and allow for multiple demonstrations of their understanding.</p>

<p>I work with teachers of all kinds--many from Latin American countries. I tinker around with activities that will help teachers understand this question: What is it like to have a "learning disability?" One of my constraints is to use recycled or simple materials accessible even in rural areas. One of the games I came up with is the following:</p>

</div></a></div> </p>
<p>The Dyslexia Game<br/>from Dr. Cynthia Herbert, The Foundry, drherbert88@gmail.com</p>
<p>Preparation:<br/>•	Have on hand a stopwatch or watch with a second hand.<br/>•	Gather 20 bottle caps, buttons, poker chips or other small objects, in two different colors.<br/>•	Number the objects in each color from one to ten. Variation: If you have a lot of different small objects or they are not in two colors, stick one of two colors of Avery dots on them before numbering them. <br/>•	Put the objects in two vertical lines with the numbers in order. Allow 3 or 4 inches between the two lines. <br/>Rules for Round One:<br/>•	Two people play.<br/>•	One person will point to the “1” in the first line/color and then to the “1” in the second line/color; the “2” in the first line and then the “2” in the second line—through all the numbers to “10.” They must actually touch each object and say the number as they do so. <br/>•	The second person will time and record how many seconds it takes the first person to complete the task.<br/>•	Switch roles and repeat. <br/>Rules for Round Two:<br/>•	This time the objects in the second line/color should be randomly shaken and dropped. Note: If some objects land upsidedown or backward, just leave them that way. <br/>•	Try to play the game the same as in Round One.<br/>Reflect:<br/>•	What happened? <br/>•	Which round was easier? Why?<br/>•	How did you feel doing the second round?<br/>Interpretation:<br/>•	Imagine that one line/color is your visual system and the other is your auditory system.<br/>•	In order to read, you have to match the visual picture of a word (think of the green line) to its auditory counterpart (think of the white line). This is the essence of phonics. In the game, this is like trying to read a 10 letter word, one letter at a time.</p>
<p>Visual:  	 s    c   r   a   m   b    l  i   n g<br/>Auditory:	/s/ /c/ /r/ /a/ /m/ /b/ /l/ /ĭ/  /ŋ/ </p>
<p>•	Now imagine that one of your systems is “scrambled.” (Think of Round Two.) No matter how you try, you cannot make the match as quickly as a good reader. There is nothing wrong with your intelligence. You aren’t lazy. As a matter of fact you have to work much, much harder.<br/>•	Imagine that after this matching process is completed, you have to put the 10 pieces (letters) together to make a whole (word). How hard is it to keep the sound of piece (letter) “1” in mind as you travel down the line (word)? In Round One, this is do-able. In Round Two, it takes super human effort. </p>
<p>People who have trouble reading are not stupid. People who have trouble reading are not lazy. Their task is simply Herculean!</p>
