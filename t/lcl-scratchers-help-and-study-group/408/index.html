<p>I've had bits of trouble myself along the way with Scratch. Sometimes, I might be experimenting with a new function I have not explored much yet and find myself obstructed from getting a desired result. Other times, I might try some code that I think should work fine and I get unexpected results. Sometimes, I can track down the culprit code but other times seem more difficult. And still other times I simply do not have any idea on where to begin with code to get a desired result.</p>
<p>From past LCL Scratch albums, I know everyone participating explores Scratch in different ways so it stands to reason we would all have different experiences. Maybe discussion and collaboration about different ways of doing things in Scratch will be useful.</p>
<p>Is anything specific tripping up anyone in Scratch? Do you have any code you would like to share that addresses a specific type of desired effect in Scratch?</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a good thread to have here or elsewhere if at all, but it seems potentially reasonable.</p>

<blockquote>If it is your first time using Scratch or even if you are an educator, you could find useful this gallery where you can find a compilation of projects to be used for getting started with Scratch 

Generally, the projects already include the blocks to be used; you have to attach them in the right sequence and/or modify the parameter's values inside the blocks. Start from Hoc1 and follow the sequence 

Do not hesitate to ask for any help you need [wink]

<p>After several attempts I stepped away from Scratch.  I wonder if there's a group out there that would want to do a how-to-scratch step by step hang out.  I learn best when I learn with others and watch how others try things - and can get immediate help when I get stuck</p>

<p>That's a really fun idea! I would be interested for sure! There's no telling what they will have planned for the LCL Hangout the week that seems to focus more on Scratch, but we could surely dive in of our own accord. We could try a one-time deal, or do something recurring that covers basic projects like the different Scratch cards and specific desired effects people are trying to accomplish.</p>
