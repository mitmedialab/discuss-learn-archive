<blockquote><p>It would be great to see more material linking Scratch to learning objectives.  I know they are there, but for a teacher that doesn't know Scratch, it's not clear what they are and how to use Scratch to address them.  I'm sure there are resources out there.  I just have to dig in and look for them. Thanks!</p></blockquote></aside>
<p>I'm interested to hear the types of learning objectives you're particularly interested in, as Scratch can be used to support a variety of concepts and practices (for example, developing persistence and problem-solving skills; learning to create dynamic models of concepts from other subject areas--or for specific computational and math concepts, such as x-y coordinates or variables). </p>
<p>I wonder if you've seen the <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu">ScratchEd site</a>, which includes a range of resources, including <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/stories">educators' stories</a> and a <a href="http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/curriculum-guide-draft/scratch-curriculum-guide-draft-feedback">draft curriculum guide</a>? Also, as part of a creative computing online workshop they hosted last spring, they posted a series of <a href="https://creative-computing.appspot.com/videos">Scratch nuts and bolts videos</a>.</p>
<p>Interested to hear your thoughts and suggestions...</p>

<p>Here is just an example of learning object. Using this scratch project challenge, teachers and educators can provide their students a more engaging way to study the <strong>Ohm Law</strong> (or at least is what I guess)</p>

<p>Here is another LO example (click on the picture to see the scratch project)<br/>You can create your own LO depending on your needs, maybe remixing others LO or creating from zero. Students can help / collaborate / be the maker/ of LOs</p>

<p><span class="mention">@CyberParra</span> <span class="mention">@natalie</span>  Thanks for all these links.  I will take a look at them.  The curriculum guide  will be helpful.  </p>
<p>Has anyone thought of creating a lesson-plan data base where teachers could submit in their ideas?  </p>

<p>Here's a Scratch project I made specifically about CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.1.1.E (1st grade verb tense recognition for Common Core in the US):</p>

<p>I tried to set it up so that educators and learners could set up their own scenes based on interests, but I included a few sample scenes.</p>
<p>This works with just a keyboard, but can also work with MaKey MaKey and includes build instructions for an example MaKey MaKey invention (time travel wand) to control the study/review game. I also tried to set this part up so that it could be easily changed and experimented with.</p>

<p>Thanks!  I actually came by this Scratch project and favourited it before you mentioned it.  It was a link on the right hand sidebar on the page about the circuits.</p>
<p>Seeing these teacher created activities also helps me see the possibilities...</p>

<p>I was using Scratch for Math class with 5th graders. The content was angles in polygons. I asked students to draw from squares to hexagons and later circles. But I never explain them theoretics about the sum of the angles. Then they disccover and build the idea of a polygon sum of internal angles. </p>
<p>The idea is to challenge students  to draw and compare the procedures they used to build the polygons and then discuss the  theoretics (the axiom of the polygons internal angles sum)</p>
