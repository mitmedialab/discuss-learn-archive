<p>Greetings Earthlings!</p>
<p>My name is Griffin, which is my mother's maiden name and the name of a half-lion half-eagle mythical creature which was first introduced by the Egyptians around 3300BC. I'm currently a student in the International Education Policy program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and working at the Media Lab.</p>
<p>I have a background in investment banking and playing drums. I worked for UNICEF in <a href="http://kyrgyzstandard.com/">Kyrgyzstan</a>, am <a href="http://bearh.at/">good friends</a> with a black bear, and <a href="http://2big2failbus.wordpress.com/">once drove</a> a school bus from London to Ulan Bator. I'm planning on making a film this summer about Scottish Independence.</p>

<p>My name is Philipp. I am interested in how people make deep connections with each through learning - mostly online. I design and create online learning tools and communities. I am also interested in how people make deep connections through food (but that's for another time). In 2009 I founded Peer 2 Peer University with 4 friends, when we realized that it was possible to learn anything online, if you had a few friends to learn with (and really hard without the friends). </p>
<p>I've lived on three continents and travelled on 5. I moved to Boston from Cape Town and am now happily based at the MIT Media Lab, but my dad's family is from southern Hungary and you never know when my Gypsie roots will call again. </p>
<p>I have a weakness for old cars and believe the perfect number of old cars to own is N+1, where N is the number of old cars you currently own. I currently own a 1967 Mercedes that is standing in a garage in Germany and which I haven't driven for 15 years. </p>
<p>LCL2 will be fun!</p>

<p>Hi all, my name is <strong>Adriano</strong> and I live in Roma, Italy. I'm currently working at educational projects about <strong>Creative Computing and Educational Robotics</strong>, to be proposed mainly for afterschool activities.<br/>After a twenty-year career as telecommunication engineer in multinational companies (Cap Gemini Group and Ericsson), I said to myself:  <em>it's time to change</em>. Around a table with a few friends, one day we asked ourselves: - What about to set up an eLearning company?  Yes , let's do it . It was a great experience, and when you work for your own company, your work is handyman. But after three years it was time  to change again: technological consultancy and web. In the meantime, I decided to not to leave anymore ideas to rot in the drawer. So, for instance, I have created and self published, GeoFilm Roma, a book about movies filmed in Rome, that uses QR codes to provide multimedia content via smartphones. But it was time to change again. I have been fascinated by Educational Robotics and <strong>after attending the first edition of LCL I have discovered the power of Creative Computing, Scratch and Tinkering in education.</strong> So, I have decided to start a new life as educator for facilitating STEAM competences in young people and not only<br/>I am passionate about history,numismatics, astronomy...<br/>I'm a maker and I like... try to guess &gt; <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3120685/">3 things I like</a></p>

<p>Hi.<br/>I´m Anders, 61(If it really matter...) from Sweden. I live in a small rural area "village" called Smedjebacken (BlackSmithHill?). Working as an ICT-somethingwithpedagogicalstuff/educator/advisor/. I tried the last LCL course, but with some kind of distance, not always doing my homework (our minister of education is probably spinning around, he´s so on to orderliness), but enjoying the talking heads (Hangout-sessions) and G+ discussions. I even met some of the participants at the Scratchconference in Barcelona. </p>
<p>I love the creative, tinkering and making approach to learning. Spreading the words of Scratch to schools and all over the place. Trying to make it to the Scratchconference 2014 (hopefully be my third visit).</p>

<p>I'm Andy Davidson, currently on the faculty at the University of Washington in the department of <a href="http://hcde.uw.edu" rel="nofollow">Human-Centered Design &amp; Engineering.</a>  I know, it's a mouthful, but I didn't coin it. We focus on user-centered design processes to solve problems using new technologies and systems.</p>
<p>I'm interested in physical computing, specialize in prototyping systems using Arduino, and teach a variety of courses in our BS and MS programs. I also taught high school computer science for a few years and had tremendous success using Scratch and Processing and Arduino to get kids interested in computing and STE(A)M fields. </p>
<p>Now I use it to try to inspire kids of all ages!</p>
<p>Before joining the UW a few years ago, I had taught at Art Center College of Design and also at Interaction Design Institute Ivrea. I'm looking forward to learning and inspiration from this group in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Hi my name is Malcolm, I am a "graduate" of the first LCL course. Like all great learning it changed and transformed me and I feel it will do the same for all of you.</p>
<p>I have been asked to be a part of the second "journey" by the LCL team, to help in online discussions and give support in whatever way I can. I am very happy to do this and know that I will learn so much more from you all in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>As a brief introduction to myself, I am a retired teacher, headteacher and Primary Mathematics Consultant living in the U.K. I regularly blog about "lifelong learning" and have a real interest in the the importance of recent developments in neuroscience and technology to transform education from where it currently lies in the past to where it us capable of getting to.</p>
<p>I look forward to our online discussions and wish you well in your future growth.</p>

<p>Ahoy!</p>
<p>I'm the head of tech at Palisades Charter High School, and independent charter of nearly 3000 students from around LA County. In January we opened our makerspace, the Pali STEAM Shop (http://palisteamshop.org), in an ex-industrial arts classroom with high ceilings, good ventilation, great view of the Santa Monica Mountains. </p>
<p>We have two student groups using the Pali STEAM Shop this term: our MESA elective (http://mesa.ucop.edu) and our VEX robotics club. The space is lightly furnished as we are still fundraising and we are considering a “make the makerspace” summer class for students who want to help design &amp; build out the room. Next year we are planning to offer five courses in the STEAM Shop: intro electronics (Arduino, Pi, wearable tech, interactive art), Robotics 1 (DIY thru Mindstorms), Robotics 2 (3D design and humanitarian engineering), Intro to Computer Science, and additional sections of MESA. </p>
<p>I graduated from the HGSE TIE program in 2003 and have been pulling Media Lab tools into classes ever since. I enjoyed LCLv1 as it prompted me to reconnect to some of my favorite foundational texts and I’m excited to be part of LCLv2.</p>

Code Club is an initiative to introduce young children (about 9-11) to computational thinking and programming through projects. The first couple of terms are based on Scratch. <br/>I completed LCL1 and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm now looking forward to the new all singing and dancing LCL2!</p>

<p>Hello, my name is James. I loved the last LCL, and am excited about LCL2. I have yet to explore Lego WeDo or Pico, but I am still enjoying Scratch, MaKey MaKey, and TurtleArt. The biggest and most valuable takeaway for me from LCL was how it changed and enhanced my perception of creative learning.</p>
<p>I am an artist and a tinkerer. I enjoy creating, sharing, and perusing digital art, paintings, photography, fractal images, a wide range of other visual arts, music of varying genre, haiku, other poetry forms, fiction, nonfiction, humor, amateur video games, collages, and basically anything arts and crafts. I am also learning about Arduino, RaspPi, 3D printing, laser cutting, metalworking, woodworking, and whatever else I can dive into. I am multimodal and enjoy learning from collaborative workshops at my local Makerspace, books, YouTube/Vimeo tutorials, digital DIY guide, MOOCs, or whatever else I get my hands on. This leads me to awesome adventures such as LCL.</p>
<p>I'm also here as a parent of learners and because I would like to help develop future educational technologies with creative learning in mind.</p>
<p>I'm excited about LCL2! Nice to meet you all (and nice to see some of you again!)</p>

<p>I was just thinking about you, Learning Creating Learning and wondering how you've been doing. Since we last met I engaged in body aching exploration of low tech making, especially with wool felting. I can kick out a pretty sweet beret in a couple of hours now. Also exploring non violent communication, the work of Marshall Rosenberg. Looking forward to the course, although I really would prefer a physical community with shared meals to a virtual community.</p>

<p>Hello from sunny California, US.  I was part of the original LCL mooc and I'm glad to rejoin the community on a new forum.  I hope that this time I can gather a learning community here at Woodbury University to follow along with me.  Much more fun to do this as a group.  I'll send out an email to my colleagues here and see who joins up.</p>

<p>Did someone say something about an Oculus Rift game just for LCL? Yes, please!</p>
<p>I'm really excited about how augmented reality can enhance learning. I know Oculus Rift is more virtual reality than augmented reality usually, but Oculus Rift and similar is pretty interesting tech. We had guests demo their kits at my hackerspace recently.</p>

<p>Hello, all my professional life I've been working in educational stuff, but I'm not a teacher, I'm a consultant for teaching materials for use in education.</p>
<p>Most of time I have seen nice and well designed products and I have seen too well designed teaching methodologies that take advantage of they. Behind of both (materials and methodologies) I have seen always good teachers, people who likes their work. But sometimes I have found bad materials, bad methodologies, frustrated teachers and unhappy students.</p>
<p>This background had encourage me to know something more about teaching and learning process, to talk a lot with teachers and to try to live closely their experiencies.</p>
<p>Nowadays I work with educational robotics and I try to help teachers to introduce this concept in the curricula as a motivational tool to learn other topics and to estimulate multiple intelligences.﻿</p>

I'm back in my home turf of Boston, and working on the Networks' social networking website, the ClubhouseVillage.org, for youth to post digital media and tech projects and collaborate with other staff and mentors around the world.  AND lately I'm an advocate for Clubhouses to integrate more "making" activities in their Clubhouses...or just showing that they've been doing it all along but just calling it arts/crafts/engineering/DIY/design/fun.  I ghosted around last year's LCL both online and in-person since then at the monthly Boston area meetups when I can. </p>
<p>In my free time, I like to bake when my oven's not broken and volunteer with local community arts and planning events.  Right now, I can't stop listening to the LEGO Movie song...Everything really is AWESOME.</p>

<p>I am Peter, a return LCL'er.  Last year I did many of the projects (see, e.g., my scratch animation, which conveys the challenges of learning and teaching when we have to take initiative in and through relationships, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3127303/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3127303/</a> ), but the center of my tinkering was around running communities that support deep learning in connectivist MOOCs.  Learning from failed prototypes based on google+ hangouts ( <a href="http://wp.me/p1gwfa-vN" rel="nofollow">http://wp.me/p1gwfa-vN</a> ), a group of us initiated "Collaborative explorations," which have continued online almost each month since ( <a href="http://collabex.wikispaces.com" rel="nofollow">http://collabex.wikispaces.com</a> ).<br/>This direction of development takes note of how the computer clubs (highlighted in LCL) create supportive, face-to-face relations that support tinkering within some  structure.  (The structure for computer clubs is given by the technological tools; the structure for collaborative explorations adapts a "five-phase format," <a href="http://bit.ly/FivePhase" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/FivePhase</a>, for thinking, talking, listening, and reflecting.)<br/>The time spent in LCL and Collaborative Explorations has been very generative in my thinking and learning as well as in my teaching and advising as a professor, where I am challenged to provide "students with knowledge, tools, experience, and support so they can become constructive, reflective agents of change in education, work, social movements, science, and creative arts" (UMass Boston's graduate program in Critical &amp; Creative Thinking, <a href="http://www.cct.umb.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.cct.umb.edu</a>).  My explorations are chronicled in my Probe-Create Change-Reflect blog, <a href="http://pcrcr.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://pcrcr.wordpress.com</a>.  I look forward to connecting with LCL veterans and newcomers to continue these explorations, especially through the events described on another post, at <a href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/t/think-listen-share-on-our-learning-process-in-the-lcl2-mooc/177">http://discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/t/think-listen-share-on-our-learning-process-in-the-lcl2-mooc/177</a></p>

<p>Hi, Karen!<br/>We did four days of prototyping/piloting (scribblebots, LED fashion, and two days of pinball machines) on the floor during winter break weeks. We'll be taking what we learned and creating a three-week Tinkering Lab program/exhibit (likely to be located upstairs near the moose) during the summer. Keep an eye on our website or subscribe to our facebook page to be notified. I'd tell you more if we knew more at this point! It's still a work in progress. </p>

<p>Hi, I'm Brendan.  I lurked a bit in LCL1, and I've taken part in a few other edu-MOOCs, like <strong>Ed Startup 101</strong> and <strong>Designing a New Learning Environment</strong> (DNLE.)  I'm excited to see LCL run again, and I'm planning to more fully participate this time around.  These forums look like a good start, and I really like the fact that they're open <em>before</em> a fixed start date.</p>
<p>Some of my background:</p>
<p>I really didn't like most of my formal education, and I particularly felt like most of middle school, and all of high school was a waste of time.    I've met many others who feel the same way, especially through the support forums on School-Survival.net (which also has a small <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/113786228047443107328" rel="nofollow">G+ community</a>.)</p>
<p>Many of the young people there are very interested in learning, but find school to be a barren, oppressive, and even hostile environment.  In contrast, especially over the past couple years, I've met a lot of educators through various MOOCs, G+, and so on who are interested in transforming education to be learner-centric, interest-based, and overall completely different than so-called "factory model" schools that remain the unquestionable norm for many people.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best single video I've found that sums up the problems with factory-model schools is Ken Robinson's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U" rel="nofollow">RSA Animate - Changing Education Paradigms</a> talk.  Despite having over 11 million views, millions of young people are stuck in learning environments that they find to be the antithesis of learning... without any real means or standing to initiate substantive conversations about doing things differently.</p>
<p>I think these edu-MOOCs have great promise in helping to facilitate discussions about transforming education to be interesting, relevant, and supportive... but huge gulfs still remain.  I'm very interesting to see how LCL2 can help bridge some of those gulfs.</p>

I want to mix the educational and tecnology backgrounds with this new concepts that I´ll start to learn here.<br/>This is the second MOOC I´m participating on.

<p>Greetings. My name is Qazi Fazli Azeem, I am a Fulbright Scholar from Pakistan at MassArts Dynamic Media Institute, and a visiting graduate researcher at the MIT Media Lab. I did last years LCL course, and it was the most fun I have had in years. I went overboard in my writing assignment, due to so many interesting prompts and examples, learning from my classmates and international forum posters. I am the south asian self advocate for the Autism spectrum, I presented at the UN in NY for last years Autism awareness day. My current thesis is about inclusive technologies to help learners with multiple and special learning styles. I believe in the potential of online and open educational materials. I saw LCL grow from being an online course in to a vibrant community, where people shared their creative creations from all over the world. I may not be able to attend all the sessions, but will try to attend most of them. Good luck to the new co-learners and students.</p>

<p>hello! i'm kate.

<p>i think one of the reasons i struggled with lcl the last go-around (and, let's face it, my entire educational career) was because i didn't really understand that i learned differently. lcl did get me thinking about that. although i don't have access to a definitive diagnosis, i am positive i have nonverbal learning disorder. it would be neat to hear from anyone else with nvld, especially people with learning disabilities who became teachers themselves.</p>

<p>During my cursory glance last weekend, your post caught my attention. This sounds like an amazing start:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next year we are planning to offer five courses in the STEAM Shop: intro electronics (Arduino, Pi, wearable tech, interactive art), Robotics 1 (DIY thru Mindstorms), Robotics 2 (3D design and humanitarian engineering), Intro to Computer Science, and additional sections of MESA.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hi everyone<br/>I am Kevin Hodgson, and I teach sixth grade out in Western Massachusetts, and I am part of the Western Massachusetts Writing Project. I'm here in LCL to continue my own exploration of Connected Learning and composing with new media, building on some of the work we did this past summer with the Making Learning Connected MOOC project. <br/>As a writer, I tinker and play with technology and writing quite a bit, and some of that tinkering makes its way into my classroom. Not all, but some. I am fascinated by the ways in which our views of writing is changing, and how we are in the midst of this change, trying to make sense of it even as the ground continues to shift.<br/>I blog at <a href="http://dogtrax.edublogs.org/" rel="nofollow">Kevin's Meandering Mind</a> and tweet as <a href="https://twitter.com/dogtrax" rel="nofollow">@dogtrax</a>, and collaborate whenever the chance arises.

<p>It's simple, I like to keep my ear the ground but these days with so many rumblings and ruminations I want to get closer to the epicenter. People ask me when I'll finish my EdD in Instructional Tech, and the answer is...soon. I'm a former classroom teacher, EdCamp Organizer and currently Tech Coordinator of an Independent School in Atlanta. I look forward to letting the ideas soar in this group.</p>

<p>Hi. My name is Jetro and I live in Spain.

I hope to have a great time and implement some of the things I learn in the classroom as well as with my kids (3 and 7).</p>

<p>Hi Maria,<br/>Your introduction caught my attention as your description of you teaching could have been mine as well.  I too teach ICT &amp; CS but in the US and in Elementary.  Perhaps as the course proceeds we can exchange lesson ideas and teaching strategies.  This is my third MOOC that I have taken this past year.  I have gain more knowledge and inspiration from these courses then I have ever received from professional development provided by my school district.<br/>Sandy</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am a Specialised Learning Leader (a role based around curriculum development) at Hobsonville Point Secondary School. This brand new school - we have been open since February and been in our new building for only 2 weeks - has awesome open learning spaces and a HUGE maker space. </p>
<p>Originally from a Social Sciences background, in addition to 'normal teaching' I am taking guerrilla geography and robotics during our flexitime and a big project based on 'future learning technologies' where the students (and I) will be using Makey Makey, arduino, e-textiles etc.</p>
<p>I have a massive interest in creativity and curiosity in education, it was only natural that I would end up tinkering with technology!</p>

<p>Hi Brenda,</p>
<p>Our school is aiming to break apart the subject silos and look to amplify the natural connections between these. So, we have no Department structures. The specialised learning leaders are a group of 4 of us that oversee the curriculum development for all learning areas in the school. This post from my blog describes the curriculum structure we developed: <a href="http://stevemouldey.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/enabling-constraints/" rel="nofollow">http://stevemouldey.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/enabling-constraints/</a> </p>

<p>Hi Steve<br/>Thanks for your reply. I just read your post on Enabling Constraints and I was wondering if you could clarify what you mean by subject silos. Do you mean subjects like Maths or English?  In your post there was no mention of any of the 'traditional' subjects so how do you meet parent expectations for their students and then how do your students get into Uni?  Are there curriculum laws that you must meet in NZ?<br/>Cheers<br/>Brenda</p>

<p>Hi Sandy, many things in common, then. I have been teaching at the elementary school , too, for the last 4 years. It's so nice to work with very young children! They have such a vivid imagination. Perhaps less skillful, but so creative! I enjoy so much to immense into their chaotic sentimental universe.</p>
<p>And I 've also changed many jobs till turning into a teacher, always around technology though. Once I used to be a database engineer, then I did some project management for a couple of years for educational technology projects, then I taught java at the university and finally I am here at the elementary school as an ICT and CS teacher and as a mom of two boys 8 and 11 years old. <br/>Hope to have time to explore new teaching ideas together,<br/>maria</p>

<p>My name is Brenda and I live in Queensland, Australia. I found this on twitter and I thought it would be a great place for me to get some PD on great technology learning for my classroom. <br/>I have been teaching 13 - 17 year olds for 18 years and it feels like education is headed for a revolution. I really don't think I am giving the students the skills they will need when they start looking for a career.  I am hoping this will help. <br/>When I'm not teaching I do adventurefits with friends, camping with my boys, photography and some scrapbooking. I loved travelling through the UK and Denmark last year. </p>

This seems like a great class to follow up to that. I hope to learn from this class on learning styles, activities through technology and peers, and more. My background morphed from outreach to disadvantaged communities, legislative education, to marketing, branding through events, and now using all those to bring youth to experience the world.

<p>My name is Carmelo, I'm a software developer from Italy who loves to learn, share and play with kids.</p>

<p>Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Hee I, and I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill. I am interested in developing new technology that will help children learn to design, experiment, build, communicate, and collaborate! Currently, I am developing tools for children with visual impairments to learn how to code.</p>
<p>I strongly support Dr. Resnik’s idea that as people learn to code, they learn invaluable skills such as problem-solving, innovation, creativity, and teamwork for life in 21st century. I am looking forward to being a part of the LCL community and learning to develop new technologies that help every child to play and collaborate, grow up as creative builders, and above all, have fun!</p>

<p>I am Greg McVerry from CT. I am a researcher and teacher at Southern Connecticut State University.</p>
<p>I recently was awarded a fellowship to create an online role-playing environment to teach argumentative writing. I want to include ideas such as: biased think alouds as AI "read" sources they agree and disagree with; some rudimentary gamification of basic source evaluation skills, and multimodal multigenre publishing.</p>

I participated in LCL last year and fell in love with it to the point that my husband bought me an Arduino for Christmas. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/smile.png" title=":smile:" width="64"/> I am currently installing a special room in our house for tinker room for myself and my two daughters (the ones I HackSchool)--we're calling the room The Zap Shack. Coming back to LCL stoked to refresh my understanding and glean more ideas for teaching my daughters to love all things learning like their parents. They both (ages 5 &amp; 7) started on Turtle this week. </p>
<p>I'm so ready to start continuing the journey!<br/> </p>

<p>Hello!  I'm Mary (metz2u) I made the attempt to be a part of this group last year without having the technology to support it.  I am delighted to have been invited back, &amp; I look forward to interacting with all of you. I am exploring what will be next in my expanding Work life...I have been included in the formation of a small Education Group. I believe participation with Media Lab will help me to add value to that process.</p>

<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>My name is Elijah. I am a science educator, currently out on long-term medical leave. Hopefully this means I'll have time to really enjoy this course. I loved it last time around, but my participation eventually dwindled due to work pressures. Once I get the health issues figured out, I'm looking at transitioning more into my photography and natural science education business (Whimbrel Nature) and also other non-traditional formats for promoting science education, creativity, and making.</p>
<p>As I said, I'm an avid nature photographer. You can check out my work at <a href="http://www.bestnatureimages.com" rel="nofollow">www.bestnatureimages.com</a>. I'm a birder and for my PhD I studied improvisational song learning in birds. Here are a few random interesting facts about me:</p>
<p>-I spent a season (and a few more weeks later on) banding hawks and owls at Cape May, NJ (owl banding focused on the tiny saw-whet owl)</p>
<p>-I had a very brief speaking part with Alan Alda (in a Scientific American Frontiers episode focusing on my advisor's research)</p>
<p>-I was a 1992 delegate to the National Youth Science Camp in WV (and spent many years working on staff there)</p>
<p>-I love the outdoors and have at least tried most outdoor sports, among my favorites are hiking, camping, whitewater kayaking, and caving. </p>

<p>Hi,everyone! I'm Heloisa Zalcberg (Heloisa Zal), from Sāo Paulo, Brazil. I enjoyed very much LCL last year and extended the experience to CCOW. I became happy meeting people who also think the things in education should change - and much! The new experience was wonderful, enriched very much by discussions and works with people all around the world, from very different cultures and backgrounds. I'd like to thank Mitchel, Natalie and Philipp for providing this new opportunity!</p>

<p><strong>Greetings People of the LCL2 Persuasion</strong>...I'm Shari, I am an international development professional specializing in the area of Social Change throughout Africa and Asia.  I participated in the inaugural LCL1 last year and it greatly impacted how I approach and carry out my social change work.  In particular, another colleague and I took what we learned here last year, and re-designed how we approach creating learning environments, as well as re-tooling how we design actual learning events.  I work following what's called Human Rights-Based Approaches (HRBA for those who want to add another acronym to their list), and the creative learning principles I learned last time really helped me re-think what "learning" is and the differences between training, teaching and learning.</p>
<p>I am really excited to being this second round of LCL, and see what this iteration brings forth.</p>

<p>Hi.  My name is Chris and I am the Dean of Students and Director of the Full STEAM program at a 7-12 college preparatory school in Los Angeles.  In my job, I work with teachers to create courses that blend their unique passions with the skills that our students will need for the jobs of tomorrow.  My hope for the future is that learning never has to feel like school for teachers or students.  To be innovative, playful, inspiring and entrepreneurial is all that I ask of my students, my teachers and myself.   </p>
<p>I am blessed to have three beautiful girls, my wife and two young daughters, to spend my time away from school with.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with and getting to know the amazing group of educators at the LCL!<br/>Chris</p>

With the youth I work with we do projects in Scratch, Makey Makey, and WeDo. We also participate in VEX robotics.  All creative learning base.  Lets get it started.</p>

<p>Hi I'm Debby (Oakland, CA) - I just read the 139 posts before this.  What a group!  Simultaneously exciting and intimidating.  I participated in most of LCL1 and totally enjoyed the brain stretch, the possibilities, and the community.  I admit I had trouble with Scratch but am here again to learn some more, connect some more and try Scratch again.  I coach teachers and organize PD opportunities and if there's one thing I've learned it's - honoring the multitude of diverse learners is critically important, not always easy, but ultimately more rewarding.  Looking forward to LCL2</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I am Aruna Sankaranarayanan, but I've learnt from experience that it's better to introduce myself just as Aruna. I work at a startup called <a href="http://www.bwmag.in/" rel="nofollow">Brainwave</a>, a science magazine, where I am currently working on gamifying all the magzine content for a new online project. I absolutely love my job!</p>
<p>I always happen to find education projects that I want to be involved in. I did some work with the Oracle Think.com project in high school, and happened to find this lovely book, Algorithms Unplugged in college that I loved! I think all of this has a little bit to do with me reading Toto-Chan when I was in 7th grade, and feeling more than a little affectionate about the book.</p>
<p>I am a huge open-source enthusiast and have been part of both local linux users groups in Bangalore and organisations like the GNOME Foundation and KDE. My local linux users group runs a few community computing centers to bridge the digital divide between underprivileged children and under-represented groups here in India. I am particularly interested in using LCL2 at these centers, along with activities from Computer Science Unplugged which we plan to implement.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of the Media Lab projects having used Processing and Arduino extensively for quite a while now. I am really excited about the LCL2 because I wasn't part of LCL last year and don't know what to expect.</p>
<p>Happy learning!</p>

<p>Hello people from MIT and fellow participants,<br/>I am a teacher by passion and profession teaching in India for the past 5 years, with focus on English and Literature, but also a mix of other things to adolescents. I have been blessed to be in association with people who enjoy teaching, and are attentive to learning how to teach and teaching adults and children how they learn.<br/>I also run a slum initiative in Ahmedabad, India, which has been teaching a small group of urban slum children for the past 4 years.<br/>Knowing a few people from MIT media lab, a few MIT alumni as friends and a boyfriend who is a '13 pass out from MIT has allowed me a very intimate insight on the 'hack' mentality of MITians. And I absolutely adore the intuitive, self immersing, mistake friendly, no-nonsense approach MIT has towards learning!!!</p>
<p>Here is hoping this online 'experiment' gains fruition, and that this course benefits the likes of me, people hungry to learn, but can't afford coming to MIT.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I wish this course introduces me to the tangible as well as intangible tools to interpret activities involving children and computing.</p>
<p>I am a computer scientist and programmer working in <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/rg/" rel="nofollow">Information Retrieval</a> (IR). Of the many sub topics in IR, say, speech, video and text, I focus on text retrieval. The idea of helping children build computational structures in their minds attracts me, so in my spare time I try to work with children, observing them play with computers, and learn. In India, I used to help out a group of friends run a <a href="http://wecare.sdf.org/" rel="nofollow">home-school for girls, and a children's club</a> on Sunday evenings. Now that work has brought me to the US, I try to find time to volunteer in the DC area. Some months back I helped out at the Mini Maker Faire organised by the Kid Museum at Silver Spring in Maryland. Next week I'll be working with the Kid Museum again, at their <a href="http://kid-museum.org/upcoming-wssc-h2o-water-event-and-rockville-science-day/" rel="nofollow">WSSC H20 Water Event and Rockville Science Day</a>.</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>My name is Megan and I currently work for an awesome organization, based in Cape Town, called <a href="http://www.siyavula.com" rel="nofollow">Siyavula</a>. Siyavula is an Nguni word meaning "we are opening" as we produce openly licensed maths and science resources for school learners in South Africa. I am the Content Coordinator and was responsible for producing the Gr 4-6 content in 2012 (<a href="http://www.thunderboltkids.co.za" rel="nofollow">www.thunderboltkids.co.za</a>) and the Gr 7-9 Natural Sciences content last year. </p>
<p>I am passionate about making science and maths fun, engaging, stimulating, enticing, and importantly, openly accessible, to young minds. </p>
<p>This year at Siyavula I am looking at how to take our current content for Gr 4-9 to the next level, in terms of interactivity and online learning tools that we want to develop. I am really looking forward to engaging with this community and course to see what I can learn to help what I am doing at Siyavula, but also to feed and stimulate my own mind!</p>

<p>I am Mohona Bose, currently working in the Information Technology department of Legal &amp; General America, Maryland. After doing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering I have served the IT industry for past 6 years. Now that I've got a work-life balance, I feel it's high time to carry out my passion which has always been with kids and making education interesting for them. </p>
<p>I have taught kids earlier during my college days and also in an evening school named "We care" - <a href="http://wecare.sdf.org/" rel="nofollow">http://wecare.sdf.org/</a> after office, while in India. After coming to the US, I have been to the Silver Spring Maker Fair, worked there as a volunteer, worked with the Kid's team in the UMD lab and looking forward to more such opportunities that involve children, computing and education. One such coming next week is : <a href="http://kid-museum.org/upcoming-wssc-h2o-water-event-and-rockville-science-day/" rel="nofollow">http://kid-museum.org/upcoming-wssc-h2o-water-event-and-rockville-science-day/</a>. </p>
<p>It was a wonderful experience meeting Mitch in person and I am eager to go through this session arranged by mit media lab. I am super excited to be a part of it. Unfortunately due to office schedule, I'll miss the first day session. But I shall try my best to attend all the ones that come after this. </p>

<p>Hey All!</p>
<p>I'm Jeff Sweeton- a technology educator in Chicago working with various groups including CodeCreate, The Center for Talent Development at Northwestern University and a church on the West Side. I'm also a freelance filmmaker and former Clubhouse Coordinator- I can attest first-hand to the inspiration that this approach to learning breeds! As a filmmaker and artist, I was pretty disengaged in science and math classes growing up and, discovering the Media Lab and its ideas, I realized I could command these skills too: it then became clear to me that all creativity is really universal.</p>
<p>I tried to join you all for the 2nd LCL but got kicked off the server: I've got to run now to help a student recording a documentary but I look forward to reading again what you all are doing!</p>

<p>Hi – I’m an Instructional Designer for a healthcare system in eastern North Carolina. I’m a jack of all trades type who grew into ID through creative writing, technical writing, and web design.

<p>Hi there. </p>
<p>I'm Heather, an advertising creative (boo, I know) in Minneapolis. It was fascinating today, listening to their conversation about the process of creative learning—and eerily familiar. The 4 P's are precisely what I experience and observe everyday at the office. However, work is not entirely why I'm here. I'm just a nerd. I spend my free time reading and learning everything I can get my eyeballs on. Excited to hear more of what these guys have to teach.</p>

<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I'm from the Portland, Oregon area. I'm forever caught somewhere between academia, industry, and Internet culture. I grew up in an online community and the informal learning and creativity that took place in that space is very near and dear to my heart. I'm on a journey to try to recreate and share this experience with others.</p>
<p>I am presently interested in online summer camp and the intersection between personal journaling/storytelling and hands-on learning in small virtual groups. Lately I've been exploring ways to help inspire original culture-building and collaboration through digital starter kits.</p>
<p>I like programming, design, art, and 3D modeling. I also make really bad sushi. This spring I’m trying to navigate grad school funding, wedding planning, and moving to a different city.</p>

<p>Started this class last year and did not have enough time to devote to it. Glad to see the "less is more" approach this year, which allows me to focus on the key concepts and have enough time to explore them in the weekly activity. The new online platform this year also looks more navigable. It's easy to gloss over how innovative and different these concepts are in the educational sphere -- I already notice how much more I can appreciate them after letting them simmer in my brain for the last year.</p>

<p>My name is Bob Kahn and teach middle school science and robotics. I have been teaching in private K-12 schools for over 20 years in mostly the "traditional" way. An online course that I took in the Summer of 2011 rocked my world. Last summer, I attended the MIT Science and Engineering Program for Teachers. Without a doubt it was the most quintessential educational experience of my life, as a teacher and a learner. </p>
<p>I am convinced that the four Ps is the best way for kids to learn. Desks in a row, followed by tests just doesn't do it for me anymore. I am so excited to learn more in LCL. Here are some links to a couple of blogs that I maintain: <a href="http://www.middleschoolminecraft.com" rel="nofollow">www.middleschoolminecraft.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bwsmsrobotics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">www.bwsmsrobotics.blogspot.com</a>.

<p>I am another veteran of last year's LCL, and though I confess I wasn't able to finish, it started me on a pretty amazing journey this past year. I took the Creative Computing Online Workshop, tried a bunch of new things in my teaching, and I'll be starting at the Harvard Graduate School of Education in the fall! </p>
<p>LCL1 and the ideas it led me to were a big part of all that, and I'm really excited for LCL2.</p>

<p>Hi everybody!<br/>My name is Massimo and I have been doing so many jobs I get kind of embarassed when someone asks. Basically I started as a Digital PR &amp; Social Media Manager then realized I was more keen on teaching about social media and digital cultures than writing marketing plans. After some quite good teaching experiences here and there I realized I had a special feeling with children and worked together with Fablab Torino to organize the firs Fablab 4 Kids workshops. At the moment I am working on a project to teach kids about the basic concept needed to browse the internet safely and smartly without the need of any digital device. That's why I particularly like the kindergarten approach! I live in Turin, Italy.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm a digital media designer and interested in creative learning. Creating for me has always been a sort of a second nature. I'm good at creating idea's and opening solutions. What I never knew or was aware of though was "how I did it". So is there some sort of model behind my way of thinking?</p>
<p>What made me more curious about this 'sort of model' behind my creativity and took me here was the moment that I applied for a job as teacher creative thinking. So I would like to embed my experience and creativity in more didactical skills in order to help others (children, students) to get back to the wonderful world of playful thinking.</p>

<p>I'm a fairly new middle school teacher in southern Maine.  By no means am I freshly out of school, it just took me a while to figure out what I would be happy doing.  I received degrees in accounting and economics, sold panoramic sports pictures, became an insurance agent, and then eventually decided to make my way towards becoming a teacher.  What I loved about all my jobs was explaining things to people and helping them understand how to help themselves, and I've always loved learning new things along the way.

As of next year I'll be teaching 6th grade digital citizenship, 7th grade Intro to Coding (a brand new class in our middl school), and integrating technology, media skills, and literacy into other classrooms.  </p>
<p><strong>I want to be a better teacher!</strong>  I want to always be excited about what I'm teaching, how I'm teaching it, observe and learn from my mistakes, try and fail, try again and succeed, and have classrooms full of engaged students.</p>

<p>Ugh the pressure to inspire!  I am a veteran educator and former public high school principal in Georgia.  I have a beautiful, smart and talented college freshman who keeps me on my toes.  I have recently decided to start a new chapter and am taking the time to professionally develop myself.  With a background in math and computer science,experience in online and hybrid learning this opportunity was right up my alley.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to catch up to what is current, learn how to help teachers transform instruction using available technology resources and meet our students, the digital natives, where they are to positively impact their learning experience.</p>

<p>I run a creative commons online wine education startup (<a href="http://winefolly.com" rel="nofollow">Wine Folly</a>). Our team creates educational art designed to help consumers. We serve over 12M educational assets to people from around the world every month and maintain viewership exceeding 1M/mo. </p>
<p>We are launching an intuitive learning platform in 2015 that attempts to turn the relatively dry science of wine into actionable information wine consumers can use within the context of their everyday lives. It's a work in progress; our current site functions as a blog where we are testing static mixed media.</p>
<p>I believe many of the values of this class are inline with what we have been trying to do at our startup. We believe that adults can benefit from exercising this sort of creative feedback loop when enjoying wine and see immediate social/economic benefits.</p>

I am currently installing a special room in our house for tinker room for myself and my two daughters (the ones I HackSchool)--we're calling the room The Zap Shack. Coming back to LCL stoked to refresh my understanding and glean more ideas for teaching my daughters to love all things learning like their parents.

<p>For some years now I've been fooling about trying to learn about creative processes through different sources, making my own tools for inspiring other people (games, workshops, exploration introductions, and so on). <br/>Being at a public library I feel a strong need for supporting my community into using better methods and solutions in their daily life, study and work. <br/>In our educational system there's a stronger and stronger focus on usability and PISA, leaving the creative kids with diagnoses or sheer boredom. It's like shooting all wildlife to save livestock, only to ruin the ecosystem of human progress, focusing on a purely short term, economical outcome. Time to change that!<br/>Yes, I'm passionate about this, thank you. But passion is 1 of the 4 P's, right?  c",)</p>

How to design creative space/environment and how to organize our our education programmes and the content to promote creativity and new ideas.

<p>Hi new friends! My name is K-Fai and I work at the Free Library of Philadelphia. I run the <a href="http://makerjawn.org" rel="nofollow">Maker Jawn Initiative</a>, a daily afterschool maker program in libraries across North Philadelphia. I help to herd and steer our amazing team of Maker Mentors, nearly a dozen people with backgrounds that include computer science, video production, and art, who guide youth as they identify and articulate their own creative, personal, and future-thinking goals, mostly through the creation of artifacts (videos, eTextile projects, etc) that serve as communal talking-points. Visited with a lot of folks from LLK at DML last month, and I'm really psyched because our entire Maker team is participating in the Learning Creative Learning MOOC and dedicating time during our weekly meetings to discuss the topics. Sometimes you get so entrenched in being a practicioner, that it's hard to step back and reflect, and that's what we hope to use LCL to do!</p>

<p>Hello!<br/>My name is Eva Söderberg and I live in Sweden. I signed up for this MOOC with shaky fingers because I´m not quite certain that I belong. I´m fascinated by creativity and how we learn things, but my field of creativity is more in the line of handiwork and this seems to be a lot about technics. I have a textile background, constantly making something. Clothes, textile art, embroidery, but also ceramics and silversmithing. I need to be working on at least a couple of projects so I don´t get restless. </p>
<p>I´ve been working as a teacher for almost 15 years now and I feel that I´ve found the job for me. I teach kids from the age of 12 to 15 and my subjects are Swedish and Slöjd. Perhaps you could translate "slöjd" with craft (textile, metal and woodwork), but I´m not sure it totally covers it. I teach the kids to use the tools and the materials that´s the most obvious, but more important is the skill to experiment and believe in your ability to make things. The process of what you are working with is in focus, preparedness is the word that appears when I try to translate the Swedish word. </p>
<p>My teaching involves using computers a lot, especially teaching Slöjd. Everything is to be found on youtube, and on the internet and I encourage the kids to think for them selves, try to find the tutorial for what they don´t know but also to make the tutorial when they found out how things work. I´ve come across the Maker Movement a lot lately and my personal challenge as a teacher now is to find a way to work with other materials in Slöjd. I can´t clearly express what    I´m hoping to find but I know this was the reason for me to sign up for this MOOC.</p>

I teach graduate and undergraduate courses in Management, Quality Management, Organization Development, Creative Problem Solving and Research Methods, to name a few.</p>
<p>Here are a few things about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a classically trained flutist but my newest instrument is the double bass.</li>
<li>I have a house full of pets but the vast majority live outside as I am a beekeeper with two hives (about 80,000 honeybees in the backyard in mid-summer).</li>
<li>Along with my fiancé, we write song lyrics and compose music; I love to sing but I cannot carry a tune.</li>
<li>My area of expertise is quality management and I have traveled the world helping organizations improve their quality either through consulting or through auditing.</li>
<li>I ran the MBA &amp; MS Management degree programs for 10 years and, until recently, I was the Department Chair for 3 years.  Now I am just teaching/advising again and finally have time to join classes like LCL (for which I am very grateful!).</li>
<li>It is very exciting to be part of the LCL and I am looking forward to getting to know many of you and to working with you!</li>

<p>What an inspiring text about teaching! <br/>What you are about to start (digital citizenship and media skills) doesn't exist in the Swedish curricula, at least not as a subject, but since so many schools have 1-1 (all kids get a laptop or an ipad) it has to change I think.

<p>Thanks for the encouragement!  I use quite a few lessons from <a href="http://www.commonsensemedia.org/" rel="nofollow">Common Sense Media</a> and recently began including more community circles to discuss some challenges students have, there are so many things to tackle that don't have  correct or incorrect answers in this new digital world.  Our school is encouraging integration of Restorative School Practices in our classrooms, so I'm taking steps to introduce them to my classes.  Incorporating this strategy with the concepts and tough decisions involved with being a good digital citizen has been a great combination for genuine thought-provoking discussions.  We'll see over the next two years if it makes a great difference in their online decisions.</p>

<p>I've been a weaver since high school and when I was teaching third grade, I found that weaving was a really wonderful experience for many of my students.  My students learned about fibers from around the world and different weaving practices.  I am reintroducing weaving into our Design Lab because I want to have a learning environment that promotes creation in both the physical and virtual worlds.  I've started to investigate soft circuits, conductive thread, LEDs, and more.  I just purchased some Gemmas to try with students some soft circuits.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br/>I think I read almost all introductions, and it was quite fascinating, learning about such different backgrounds and organizations you are enrolled in ! </p>
<p>I'm Laura, I grew up in a french caribbean island, and I am thankful for this childhood in nature. I discovered education and technology back in 2009 when I joined the <a href="http://laptop.org" rel="nofollow">One Laptop Per Child</a> community. I have worked with OLPC in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laura_nk/sets/72157627901247563/" rel="nofollow">Madagascar</a> ( 3 summers), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laura_nk/sets/72157629653480629/" rel="nofollow">Haiti</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/laura_nk/sets/72157629235966967/" rel="nofollow">Jamaica</a>. It was a tremendous adventure. <br/>I graduated with a master of international business which I try not to regret since it taught me a lot, but thanks to OLPC I found my true love which is education/technology/learning/kids/creativity, and this why I am here <img alt="smile" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/smile.png" title=":smile:" width="64"/> <br/>I like music, painting, taking picture, singing really loud, kids, and one day I want to build my own sailboat with sails of different colors, solar energy, and I want to be able to grow flower fields on the deck, so we could exchange flowers for books while traveling around the world. I also have a thing for maps. <br/>I look forward to discovering through this course !<br/>Cheers, <br/>Lau </p>

<p>My name is Steve Ciampaglia and I am an Asst Prof of Art + Design Education at Northern Illinois University. I am in the process of developing a curriculum for the middle and secondary art classroom, rooted in Art + Technology practice, featuring PicoCrickets, Scratch, Stencyl, Processing, CMU's Hummingbird, littleBits, Squishy Circuits, and Modkit/Arduino/Lillypads as the centerpieces.</p>
<p>Along with Kerry Richardson, Adjunct Asst Prof of Film, Video, and New<br/>Media at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, I am the co-founder<br/>and co-director of The Plug-In Studio (http://pluginstudio.net/), an<br/>autonomous, self-contained, and entirely portable Art + Technology<br/>classroom that brings technology-based art-making to underserved children<br/>and teens in community learning sites in Chicago. We bring netbooks loaded<br/>with Scratch, PicoCrickets, littleBits, teachers, and curriculum, and simply plug into the existing physical sites of our community partners in order to<br/>provide free/low cost after school Art + Tech classes.</p>
<p>Nice to meet all of you.</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p>I´ve never been a weaver myself, well I´ve tried but I´m more into making clothes, embroidery and different kinds of yarn techniques but I do agree with you that working with the materials, creating things is a great experience for the students. I have just started to think about using conductive thread with embroidery in class but I don´t really know where to start and I don´t know if I have the time or budget for it...</p>

<p>Here's a PDF you can check out with some information and  further resources about <a href="http://www.maine.gov/education/bullyingprevention/restorative.pdf" rel="nofollow">Restorative School Practices</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is the most straightforward description:  "Restorative practices create safe schools where all members of the community are accountable for their actions, resolve conflicts, create positive relationships, and build an inclusive, respectful school culture."</p>
<p>I can tell you more if you are interested.  I've only just begun to adopt a portion of this program into my classroom, but it's already helped with behavior issues and enabled us to discuss some pretty serious topics and listening to everyone in the class.</p>

<p>Hi all! My name is Marcus.  I am a high school counselor that loves to promote creative and output based experiences for students.  I serve as an advisor to our robotics team, and to"D2E" (Dare to Explore) a club that empowers students to realize their ideas and was inspired by the MIT Media Lab.  Outside of school I run workshops for elementary aged students that mix creativity and movement.  I am also a graduate student in cognitive psychology (intelligent technologies concentration) at Teachers College, Columbia University.  Most importantly though I am a new dad, which makes me even more passionate in ensuring students have every opportunity to be creative.

<p>My name is Stella and I’m the Director of Educational Technology at an independent K-6 school in Southern California. I studied communication as an undergraduate student at the University of Southern California. I was especially interested in non-verbal communication and communication through advertising at that time. I also love to travel so when I finished my undergraduate degree I worked for American Airlines for a while.<br/>I entered into the teaching profession after I had my daughter, and through several different circumstances I took the computer teacher position at my current employer. The job started off with only 12 computers and 1 printer that were not networked. My job responsibilities were to teach K-5 students how to use the computers. I have been at the school now for 15 years and have seen many changes! My job has evolved with these changes. We now have over 120 computers, which include desktops and 2 laptop carts that are networked, projectors, printers,  RedCat microphones and ELMO document cameras. Next year we will be getting an iPad cart. I have seen a great deal of change in a relatively short amount of time. I’ve also learned a lot about networking computers and teaching others… young and old. <br/>In 2004 I received my Masters in Educational Technology from Pepperdine University. I am now the first point of contact if something goes down on the network (although we have a gentleman who is officially the network specialist but is offsite) and my position has changed to include Instructional Design. I enjoy “tinkering” with new technologies and am curious about how we all learn. I really look forward to the sharing of ideas in this class. <br/>On a personal note I enjoy cooking, traveling, photography, and snow skiing. Although I was born in Los Angeles, California, my parents are from Kalamata, Greece and I would visit there almost every summer growing up. I speak Greek fluently. </p>

<p>Hello everyone! <br/>I am very happy happy to be here with you all! <br/>I am a french-italian tech entrepreneur currently living in Brazil (São Paulo/Rio). <br/>I co-founded two startups <a href="http://www.amuseworld.net" rel="nofollow">www.amuseworld.net</a> and <a href="http://www.nanopop.com.br" rel="nofollow">www.nanopop.com.br</a>. <br/>The first one, Amuseworld is a multimedia entertainment company for little girls (age 6-12). Our dreams is to open up the girls to different cultures to make them become real citizen of the world, sharing the same strong values such as respect, courage, solidarity using technology. <br/>I have been working on this project for the past 5 years and I am now at a turning point with some ideas for spin-off that I would love to discuss further more! <br/>I am really interested in all the ways we could bring girls to embrace more scientific and engineering careers, especially through play &amp; toys. <br/>Apart from that I graduated from Singularity University in 2012, which gave me an amazing opportunity to spend 10 weeks on the NASA campus and dive in all the new and exponential technologies. <br/>Hope to get to know better some of you soon! </p>

<p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>What a lovely supportive community. I'll keep in brief as I know we have lots of reading to do. <br/>I'm an artist working mostly in installation and performance art. I am also an education consultant and visual facilitator when I'm not tinkering and working with thread to build large scale projects.</p>
<p>I am nomadic. I've lived on 3 continents - with the last 5 years in Toronto. Recently, I moved to the shores of lake Erie to a tiny fishing village full of natural wonders. When the sky is just right I can see the dim glowing lights of Cleveland and Detroit across the lake. I look forward to working with you all. <br/>I've attached a photo of some of my work but you can see more at <a href="http://www.sandrapoczobut.com" rel="nofollow">www.sandrapoczobut.com</a>. </p>

<p>Hi I am Diane Darrow<br/>I am an artist, writer, educator, and dreamer. I grew up on a small farm in Connecticut, and spent many hours playing in the woods. As a high school student, I was happiest when painting alone in the art studio. When I went to college, I choose to earn a BFA in painting. A few years later, went on to receive an MFA and show my work in galleries and museums.</p>
<p>When my son was born, I began to question why I was focusing my creative energies on object making for wealthy collectors. Deeply affected by Suzi Gablick's book "The Reenchantment of Art", I changed my vision of art making and directed my attention on building communities of learners and learning environments. I became a classroom teacher and children became my canvas.</p>
<p>Today I work with teachers and technology. My desire to foster creativity remains my life purpose. The medium have used during my life is wide reaching. It began with a crayon and pencil, then I fell in love with oil paint and later on the eyes of a child. I am interested in creation.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Henry De la Ossa de Bogota, Colombia. I have been working on finding new ways of improving education, improving the ability of teachers to teach and students learn, and the role it can play the use of ICT. We explore connectivism, the use of social networks and the possibilities offered by PLE and personal learning networks in increasing the wealth of knowledge available. I am delighted to find people so interesting participant in this MOOC.</p>

<p>Hello everyone. My name is Andrew. I took part in this class last year and absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>Currently I work in Marketing and Social Media for a leading lighting brand in the world of photography.  Education has always been a huge part of my personal and professional career.</p>
<p>As a photographer, I pride myself in learning, and try to stay as current with the ever changing technology and as a trainer I believe learning and marketing go hand and hand.</p>
<p>I hope that moving forward if anyone is looking to make a discussion group I would gladly join up, I think that also helps in the learning process.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best during your time in this class and hope to learn not only from what's presented and the projects that are given but from the community that is connected to this group.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>I'm Amy Browne, a mompreneur from CA from a family full of teachers. I am very excited to hear all of the discussions related to creative learning. Graduate work in the MIT media lab would be a dream come true so I am super excited about the opportunity to be part of this MOOC. I consider myself a "kindergarten for life" sort of person so that already struck a cord for me. My background is transdisciplinary design, new media and now parenting so my passion projects have merged into a amalgam of how to best serve my kids future world with what I have to offer it. <br/>I'm quite sure growing up in the classrooms of my family made life long learning as natural as breathing. Environment greatly set my course so I think how to provide that for my kids. My attempt at revolt was to NOT be a teacher but an artist, however now as a Mom I explore the role of creative learning ad media in my children's learning everyday as well as collaborate with their teachers. I completely agree with peer to peer learning which is why my children are in schools not homeschool and why I put effort in helping their schools be updated.Both kids were in Montessori schools until they moved to charters that are whole child. I am a huge fan of Marie Montessori's philosophy and think she was way ahead of her time. I also believe strongly in collaboration as a future necessity for survival or success and open as a human responsibility. I am currently working on projects related with teams from the games industry we hope to be in the social emotional or whole child space upon launching. Would love to see talks about tolerance in collaboration, whole child learning, balancing digital with the natural world, what character means for the next generation.<br/>Thanks again for opening this course.<br/>-Amy Browne</p>

I´m fascinated by creativity and how we learn things, but my field of creativity is more in the line of handiwork and this seems to be a lot about technics. I have a textile background, constantly making something. Clothes, textile art, embroidery, but also ceramics and silversmithing. I need to be working on at least a couple of projects so I don´t get restless.</p></blockquote></aside>

<p>Hi Massimo, I visited your blog and I'm very interested in the project MilleMolucche. I was thinking about something similar trying to use Open Source Intelligence strategy to help teenagers understand how they share very important things about themselves on internet very often unconsciously. I was thinking about a game where they should be investigators... but I still have very confusing ideas regarding how to implement it. I think that your idea to start before talking to younger children is very interesting, can you give me some more infromation about this projetct you are following? Thank you, Melissa</p>

<p>Hi Melissa,<br/>first of all, thank you for your appreciation. My idea isa basically to use methods as old as time as theatre, storytelling, role-playing games, treasure hunts etcetera to spark thoughts about how the internet works. This way we can educate children about the internet and the consumption of digital contents even without access to computers, even to the internet too. It's more like a story told and played about the internet, it's more like creating fairytales about the internet. At the moment I'm trying to sell the project to Italian schools (which by the way are totally underfunded) and it's quite tought but the projecy has been shortlisted in an Italian contest looking for the best ideas about social innovation. It didn't make to the final stage but it was great to be selected. If you like the idea we could have a chat and see if our projects can work together or have something to share. What do you think about it? </p>

<p>Nothing like making an introduction in the 11th hour!  I happened upon EdCamp, and then onto this open course.  I am a new educator (3rd grade, but next year is too far away to cal!), forward-thinking and naively but confidently optimistic about the potential future directions of education (especially blended learning and problem-based approaches).  I found the description of this course and project intriguing, and decided to hop on the LCL-train as a curious observer (to start!)</p>

<p>Hi my name is Sam. I teach core courses in science for undergraduates at Boston University and I teach in the Sustainable Design MS program at the Boston Architectural College. I started using what I call an aesthetic approach to science learning last year after spending a sabbatical thinking about the methodological/behavioral connections between science and art. I have been encouraging my students to use contemplative observation, reflection and play(!) to help them wrap their heads around science and design learning. I think it's working. So I'm happy to get connected with you and learn more about what other people are doing. </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Andrew &amp; I am from Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>I've joined LCL as I'm interested in this area of creative learning and how highly engaged community experiences can be further defined (e.g. interaction, applied behavioral economics in relation to emotional states) and applied across various sectors. I'm also applying to be a grad student with the Lifelong Kindergarten Research Group next year and hope to get accepted so I can pursue my research interests in this area academically.</p>
<p>How did this come about?<br/>I was a mentorship coordinator for international &amp; exchange students at YorkU for 2 years and during that time, our team managed to increase enrollment by 400% and participation in monthly events were consistently well attended. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014, I signed up for the MIT15930x “Who is your customer?” MOOC. At the end of the course, staff sent out an invite for those interested to come to MIT for a bootcamp this summer. I applied and was accepted. The pre-bootcamp weeks that followed were a blur, we started self organizing, first on the edX platform and then subsequently on Facebook. </p>
<p>In less than a week (working globally around the clock &amp; without having met), we managed to gather those who were selected to form a critical mass, divvying tasks up and assigning them to groups based on areas of expertise (brand creation/pr, video pitch, crowdfunding campaign, sponsorship letters, etc). Through this, I've realized how the pre-bootcamp prep was key to building a highly engaged and motivated community. When we finally met in person in Boston, it was like we already old friends and the in-person working experience at the week-long bootcamp was even more fulfilling. </p>
<p>While still recovering from the bootcamp, I've learned that (it is more fun to be a pirate than to join the navy and) it is more about the journey rather than the destination and perhaps, the best way to do this well is to journey together as a community and creatively share what we've learned to others so as to better understand it ourselves.</p>
<p>Can't wait to start off on this journey of learning creative learning with you!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br/>Andrew</p>

<p>I LOVE AMuseWorld! I have a 6 year old daughter and I coach 2 all-girls robotics teams because I am passionate about getting girls engaged in Science, engineering, and technology. What a great way to ensure they see the world in a global perspective. I recently took my daughter throughout several countries in Europe and it was the first time she had an opportunity to hear so many different spoken languages at once. And the colorful fashion and food! It was an amazing eye-opener for her. However this type of travel is not always a possibility for girls to have the experience, so this application - Amuseworld -  is brilliant!!</p>

<p>Merhaba, Hello,</p>
<p>I am a career diplomat with working experience in a variety of challenging environments from the Balkans to Afghanistan. Currently I am heading the department for G20 Outreach and Engagement at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara. </p>
<p>Having discovered "coworking" experiences of social entrepreneurs and change-makers and got fascinated by the idea of sharing an inspiring space for creative collaboration and innovation, I am connecting with people to explore these exciting concepts through Project InnoMate. InnoMate organizes three Meetup Groups in Brussels, in Luxembourg and in Istanbul. </p>
<p>With the team at InnoMate Istanbul, we have developed Project InnoCampus which will be a pop-up innovation platform travelling to universities: <a href="http://www.innocampus.org" rel="nofollow">www.innocampus.org</a> This is a non-profit social responsibility project. </p>
<p>Recently, we have applied to Horizon 2020 research and innovation program of the European Union together with 12 partners from 7 different countries. The aim of our project proposal is to make science education more innovative through FabLabs. We took the responsibility of mobile FabLabs work package. </p>
<p>One of my passions is also creative education. The TED Talk of Sir Ken Robinson on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity" rel="nofollow">"How Schools Kill Creativity"</a> (2006), the movies "The Wall" and "Dead Poets Society" truly changed my perception about current education systems. We have to do something about it now! That's why I'm here. </p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I'm Dan. I had the fortune to stumble across LCL last year and really enjoyed the community, the work, and the doors it opened for me. I jumped at the chance to be involved again, so I am back as a moderator this year. Hope I can be helpful.</p>
<p>I currently work as the Technology Coordinator at a small, independent (private) school in Boston's Back Bay area. I get to work with students from K to 6th grade, to support the faculty and staff, and to manage tech projects like the school website. For the first 17 years of my teaching career, I was a classroom teacher mostly in grades 4-6. I have also worked as a computer consultant, as an apartment maintenance provider, and in a brewery. I have two children, 3 and 6, who fill my life with all the things kids fill one's life with. When not teaching or parenting or doing educational work like this, I find some creative outlet to delve into. Currently this is designing tabletop games. I recently ran a successful Kickstarter1 for my first game and am now working on getting it published. Other projects have included writing a children's novel and, separately, bookbinding.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to giving back to the LCL after having really enjoyed it last year.</p>

<p>Hello all! My name is Tracy, I run an Instructional Technology department at a University in Maryland. The timeliness of the email I received for he latest round of this learning community was amazing. I had just returned from the DevLearn conference in Vegas where two of the keynote speakers (Neil deGrasse Tyson and Beau Lotto) spoke about play in learning, creativity and critical thinking skills as keys for educating our current generation of children and young adults. I was inspired to step up my own learning and to expand my own learning community. I am looking for ways to make my office environment one of innovation for what we do, and I'm always looking for fun an exciting ways to help faculty expand their online learning environments so that they are more interactive and effective. As a parent, I'm also looking for ways to keep my 6 year old's passionate curiosity alive (and using it to inspire myself to do the same!)</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Mauro. I'm from Buenos Aires (Argentina) but I've also lived in Valencia (Spain) and The Hague (The Netherlands) and now I'm settled in Manchester (UK). </p>
<p>I've studied Mechanical Engineering and have been working "in the industry" since, but I've grown tired of working for big projects and companies where I'm just one more cog in the machine. The last time I was happy with my job was when I was tutoring kids in Maths and Physics or when I volunteered for events that interested me (TEDx, music festivals). So now I'm dedicating all my free time to steering my career into something that I enjoy.</p>
<p>I enjoy learning new things, talking to people with passion for their ideas (they don't have to be good ones), programming, DIY technology, music, science fiction, beer and street food. Seriously, I would kill for a burger and a pint right now.</p>

<p>Hello everyone. I my name is Sandy and thrilled to be here as a moderator.  I like to introduce myself by sharing my journey here to the LCL community. </p>
<p>I came to LCL via the first MOOC I ever participated in (CCOW in the spring of 2013).  CCOW was truly a life changing experience for me (cue the dramatic music here).  It was there that I met, was inspired and learned from some amazing, talented and creative educators.  As a result I made some dramatic changes in my teaching and personal learning.  It was through CCOW that I came to learn of LCL, unfortunately I had missed the first round.  Thanks to Youtube I was able to watch all the previous videos and I jumped right into LCL2 last spring.  There I was able to reconnect and meet some new educators.  LCL2 led me to Tinkering Emporium’s Coursera course this summer on the Fundamentals of Tinkering which in a word was awesome, and facilitated by fellow LCLers, Mike Petrich, Karen Wilkenson &amp; Luigi Anzivino. All of this open up a world of knowledge and I am forever thankful.  It has made me a better educator, and do a dare say a better person…I think so.  </p>
<p>Oh and here is my standard intro with few more facts:  I am K-5 technology teacher and love my job. This is a my 4th career, my career background is fairly eclectic (from a Casino Craps Dealer, Insurance adjuster, Restauranteur to finally my dream job as a teacher) I am passionate about creative computing and learning anything new! My mission is to infected my students with that same passion. New this school year, I am running an after school Tinkering/Hacker/Maker type club, I call it the Tinkering Dojo. </p>
<p> So with all that said, I am here again to continue to be amazed, inspired and to learn.  I hope this time I can give back by perhaps inspiring a few of you to share fearlessly and freely. You'll never know where it may lead you!</p>

<p>Hi everybody!<br/>My name is Andrea, I am from Argentina.<br/>I am a Translator and teacher and MOOCs are fascinating.  They are helping me make my dreams come true.  I have always wanted to study abroad, but life sometimes can be complicated.<br/>I am learning so much with this opportunity of interacting with people from all over the world.  I am trying to persuade my students of doing MOOCs but I have come to realize that language is a problem.  Some of the intermediate learners find it very difficult to follow the ideas or participate in the forums.<br/>Probably younger students will use English more naturally than my over 30 students.<br/>I look forward to continue learning and helping others to learn.<br/>It s an honor to share this space with you!</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>My name is Beth, and I am a biology tutor and an advanced skills practitioner in information learning technology (ILT). I am interested in how online learning can be supported from both a blended (flipped) perspective, and in courses delivered completely online.<br/>I am also here for selfish reasons, as I was previously a post-doctoral researcher and briefly a lecturer in neuroscience; I just  can't stay away from research;finding out new things and passing them on. <br/>Outside of work I enjoy gardening and Chinese brush painting, though I am still getting to drips with both.</p>

<p>Hi Everyone!<br/>My name is Drew and I am currently an assistant head of a lower school in metro Detroit. I have not been a world traveler like many of you, but my adventures in life have given me fulfillment so far and a chance to meet many people on this great earth. <br/>I am fidgety and constantly needing to move my fingers or I'll go crazy. My mother would always get mad at me because I often picked at the candles on her beautiful dinner table during mealtime, or she would find my napkin torn to shreds. In school, the floor under my desk would be layered with paper crumbles or pieces of my eraser because I couldn't leave anything alone. I am also the one that tears the labels off of bottles and rolls the playbill into a periscope at every performance. It's not because I'm repressed in any way... I just can't help it! That's why today I have multiple fidget toys on my desk at work and have to carry around silly putty so that I don't destroy a piece of property. Not really, but having something to constantly fidget with could be a good thing for me. <br/>This truth about me is probably why I love creative learning. I love tinkering with just about anything and coming up with new ideas. I am hopeful this group will be a great resource for me and I can't wait to hear about the many ideas out there! Such a great idea to do this! <br/>I hope this post finds everyone doing well! <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Drew Mackay</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a Learning Experience Designer at Six Red Marbles--there are a few Marbles taking this course, so you may see us around! In a past life, I lived and taught cultural studies in Indonesia, where formal avenues for creative learning are few but where mysticism, myth, storytelling, and making are a normal part of everyday life. In an even former life I was a classical violinist and I miss that very much. My musicianship now informs my learning design, teaching and my relationships. Lastly, I love love love board games, especially Euro or strategy games and unexpectedly found friends and community in Jakarta through gaming. Excited to find out about new ways of creative learning! Best, Brittany</p>

<p>Hi everybody! My name is Elinis, I am from Brazil, but I have been out of my country since 2010.<br/>I am on my beginning my journey as a teacher and looking for what can help me to be good on it. To learn news things is fascinating. I love to help others to believe in themselves and encourage them to make their dreams come true. I am learning more when I can interact myself with people and observing what they have done around the world. I realized through my journey that language is a problem, but not a stopping point. So, I'm look forward to see what I can learn here in this community, hoping I can be able to share in the same proportion. <img alt="smile" class="emoji" height="20" src="../../../images/smile.png" title=":smile:" width="20"/></p>

<p>Welcome to LCL. More than a course this is also a community with people from different backgrounds, culture, languages, but has this passion in common. I'm happy to know that a person with your influence is such open minded and still connecting,learning and looking for making things better. The InnoCampus seems a wonderful idea!  Congrats!<br/>I've been part of this since the first LCL in 2013 and as moderator since the last edition. I've met and connected to amazing people!

<p>As a teacher, my main problem is keeping up the good work (based on my own standards). Not so much keeping up with the administration and doing what I should do, but keep going on the projects I love and that inspire the students in the same way.</p>
<p>I teach computer science in a secondary school in Vilvoorde, Belgium. I have no collegues in this course. That means I'm all by myself. Nobody to converse about ideas or problems.</p>
<p>I come here to meet inspiring people and to work on new content, together, to learn, together, to discuss, together.</p>

<p>Hello comrades!<br/> I am Jacson - surname used as a name: Brazilian things - a history teacher on the public education system. Living and working in the city of Novo Hamburgo, on the fluvial-lacustrine and industrialized region of southern Brazil.</p>
<p> I live busy days, with the end of the school year here, and the start of summer vacation just ahead in time and in mind visions. Bureaucratic and evaluation procedures coming at its final deadlines, in an inherited rigidity of the only one State Government supported in the Comte's Positivism confession at the political history. In addition, all the Brazilian educational system are in upgrade, incrementing and/or redesign process.</p>
<p>I went back to relax and meditate as in youth, now to enjoy the diffuse thinking in learning and creativity... or simply to enjoy being one. I like to sing and play musical instruments. I was a professional draftsman but currently little practice. I like long walks, riverside and singing birds. I like spontaneous kindness and genuine friendship.</p>
<p> Also, I headed the organization of the annual edition undergraduate research fair of Polytechnic High School, here where I work this year. Moreover, we have a working group in our school being so awarded in international school science fairs for developing shingles recycling PET bottles.<br/> I never before had assumed such responsibility as a teacher, but someone had to do it; after all my colleague, with whom I planned the fair, was receiving awards in Peru, with their workgroup, in the only date that the school administration has given us to do so... Still, our internal school fair was very cool!</p>
<p> Like I said, I've been busy. But now I get to share here in the community more often. See you, peers!</p>

<p>Hey y'all! I'm Paul, a 4th-year Computer Science student at Oberlin College; this is my first LCL. This summer I worked at an iD Tech in Waltham, Massachusetts, teaching the fundamentals of programming to 7-9 year-olds using Scratch, and I want to learn more about how technology can be used in the classroom. I also love playing and making games, and want to learn how they can be used as educational tools.</p>

<p>I liked what I saw from the pictures of your space. I would love to communicate with you about your experience in running your space. I run a similar thing but not from a school but from a science center which is affiliated to the organization I work for. We have students and adults come to our open to the public events. Most ofthe programs we have had using tinkering ideas to make participation a different learning experience. We are planning on bringing these programs to schools to get students to realize that knowledge can assimilated in ways other than the standarded classrooms. With what they have already they can be creative and it is important that they can still think independently. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AST_Spaces/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meetup.com/AST_Spaces/</a></p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br/>My name is Erum , I am from Pakistan, I have two lovely sons who teach me everyday about the world we all live in. I love to learn in a crazy manner, that's what landed me here. I started my learning as a group facilitator for teachers and moms of small children some 12 years ago. I got my  Montessori training and played with many 3-6 years old mixed age group classrooms for many years...as I start learning more, i realize that learning is highly individualized and experiential. I have seen kids learning in traditional desk style classrooms and have seen extremely creative learning in my Montessori classrooms and then amazingly natural learning in Nature /outdoor classrooms. As i train teachers of early childhood and others, i invite them to keep Observing kids Scientifically just as a scientist Observe and they will get the hidden formula of learning....that's highly individual experience.<br/>I am excited to be here to learn and unlearn...<br/><img height="374" src="../../../images/2ebb4a2dfa5134b6aa9b5f08f57a89223ce6448a.jpg" width="450"/></p>

I hope I can join the discussion here and learn more stuffs. I'm interested in everything, especially chemistry and neurology. I'll try hard to improve my English this summer and also learn more about the subjects I like. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/> </p>
<p>Now I'm interest in green products and trying to find more possible way to help our earth.</p>
<p>I'll do more research on neurology in the future and try to find the ways to copy memories from our brain. I know human cloning betrays our morality, but I really hope we can make one, for nothing but for science. It might helps if we use it in the right way, and I know we can do this. </p>
<p>Well, it's a hard issue, but that's my opinion about it.</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to this!</p>

<p>Hi all<br/>my journey started at a young age. tinkering from an the age of 5 with materials salvaged from dumpsters, dismantling things to see how they work, lots of wood work using scrap wood from a factory close to home. One day while visiting a friend I spotted an electronics kit. I saved up from my paper round to buy one as I was obsessed. years later I'm running a maker space at my daughters school and enjoying seeing children immerse themselves in the simple activity of dismantling and creating sculptures from the salvaged material. <a href="http://blog.facade.net.au" rel="nofollow noopener">http://blog.facade.net.au</a></p>
