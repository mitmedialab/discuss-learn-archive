<p>I'm going to try running a Hangout-on-Air tonight, based on the ideas in the thread <a href="//discuss-learn.media.mit.edu/t/creative-learning-for-those-unhappy-in-school-as-usual/639">Creative Learning for those unhappy in “school-as-usual”</a> (and various other threads, like Justin Schwamm's thread <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+JustinSchwamm/posts/c7zaR2pouYf" rel="nofollow">Owning Process, Owning Results</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We'll have a soft start around 7:30pm, with more focused discussion starting around 8pm.</strong></p>
<p>That'll give us time to sort out any tech issues.  The goal here is to introduce people from LCL2, G+, and School Survival forums who are interested in transforming education from a "sit down and comply" style (the "factory model"), to one based on <strong>creative, interest-based, and connected learning</strong>.</p>
<p>This will be the first of a regular series of discussion events on these topics.  One of the goals is to help people connect with those coming from different perspectives.  Many students on School Survival find it impossible to have and substantive conversation about their learning and perspectives with their parents and teachers.  Meanwhile, I've found all these wonderful conversations with educators who are interested in adapting how they teacher to their students, and even working as "co-learners."</p>
<p>Looking forward to anyone who wants to come, and feel free to ask questions or make suggestions here for how to facilitate the conversation!</p>
