<p>After reading Gears of my Childhood I realized it is time that I read the Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas.  As I read the book I am noticing a lot of my teaching has been taking the new materials and teaching in the same way.  If anyone is using floor logo robots (bee-bot, pro-bot, or similar) I would be interested in some of the ways that you use them in your class and some of the prompts you use with your class.  </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I am using Bee-Bots with my kindergarten.  I just bought 4 of them last month.  So far I have done some very basic lessons with them.  We have programmed them to go to a flower and back to their hive.(I used the mat with graphics)  I have teamed them up to race them.  One person from the team rolls the dice, the other programs the Bee-Bot.  Even numbers they go forward by the number on the dice, odd numbers they go backwards.  Here a link to <a href="http://www.teachers.cape.k12.de.us/~scoleman/mesclab/Home.html" rel="nofollow">my website</a> that I posted a video of my kiddos using them. Looking to do more with them as well.  I heard that there is an app for iPads as well but I do not have iPads in my lab.  Hoping that some more LCL2 can add to this conversation, I too could use some prompts. </p>

<p>Thank you for this share.  I didn't even know this existed.  I have a feeling I will be spending some time on your website.  Thank you for the wonderful resources for our younger students.</p>

<p>Hi Sandy,</p>
<p>I think we met at CCOW last summer thanks so much sandy your page is helpful I will be using this to try to convince my school we can introduce younger kids to tech.   I can't believe you get the kids to use the bee-bots on the same mat at the same time üê¢</p>

<p>The first time I try to introduce my kindergarteners to the Bee-Bots, I tried it with a class of 24 students all it once, as you can imagine it was organized chaos!  So I quickly adjusted my plan for the next class and pulled them 4 at time to play on the Mat and 8 at time for the race.  I guess after the experience of 24 kids to 4 Bee-Bots, they where more then cooperative on the mat.  Yes, I did take the CCOW last summer, I think there are quite a few CCOWers taking this course as well.  I really enjoyed the CCOW community last summer and I looks like the LCL community will be just as rewarding.</p>

<p>Can you use Scratch to program one of these robots? It would be much more interesting making a robot move! And how can we get these robots in Hong Kong?</p>

<p>I know you can use Scratch to control Lego WeDo and I think PicoBoards can work with Scratch, too. I don't have experience with this myself and don't know how LOGO floor robots fit in here. That would be very interesting, though!</p>

<p>Yes I hope I can get some of these robots for my students in Hong Kong! I was just watching the Ted talk <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hugh_herr_the_new_bionics_that_let_us_run_climb_and_dance" rel="nofollow">The new bionics that let us run, climb and dance</a> This is how kids will start to learn to build the future bionics!<br/> </p>

<p>Hi, I'm not a teacher but I'm conducting some robotics laboratories. At the moment I'm making an experience with the bee bots in a kindergarten. We are exploring the water cycle. After some meeting used to discover the object I told them the story of Drippy (http://www.drippytheraindrop.com/DrippysWorldTrial/entry.htm). I composed the story like a puzzle, to have at the end the design of the water cycle on the floor,  and then I put on the mat the salient immages of the story (evaporation, rain, etc) and I ask the children to tell the story to the bee. I'm working with group of 10 to 12 children and with 4 bee bots and 4 mats for every group. I'm enthusiastic of this experience. Children are very engaged in the lab and very happy to play with me and with the bees.</p>
