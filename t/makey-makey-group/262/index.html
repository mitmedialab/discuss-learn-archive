<p>Yesterday I was in a class (12-13yrs) and we had an Invent-A-Game-Session using Scratch, MakeyMakey (gamecontroller) and if they had time; analog output with Lego Wedo. So two girls went to the kitchen, got a couple of potatoes. Painted them in the same color (I didn´t even imagine that you actually could paint potatoes) as their Sprite in the game. Today we are going to have a small "GameCon" showing another class what we have done. I´m trying to make a short film about their Makerstyle efforts, I will share it if it´s interesting. It´s so much fun.</p>

<p>I run a Makey Makey Exploratory for 7th and 8th graders. It meets once a week for 30 minutes. Not enough time! The kids love it! I just run around and get them stuff. They say "I wonder if..." a lot. And I respond with "Try it." The kids were amazed when four or five of them held hands and the last person touched the Playdough and the keyboard worked. They want to find out if there is a limit to the number of people the signal can go through.<img height="480" src="../../../images/151cd7c6aea88f5f.JPG" width="640"/> </p>

<p>Yesterday we tried 15 kids holding hands and the signal went through without problems. It was the end of our MakeMakey-Scratch-LegoWedo-session. But it would be a great teaser to start with, it raises so many questions. Maybe next time...</p>

<p>Great to see the directions you're exploring with MaKey MaKey and Scratch. <span class="mention">@huttnerk</span> mentioned springboards: You may have seen, the MaKey MaKey site now has some <a href="http://makeymakey.com/guides/"><strong>workshop guides</strong></a>. </p>
<p>For a local creative learning workshop we organized earlier this year, Eric Rosenbaum brainstormed a list of MaKey MaKey ideas called <a href="http://goo.gl/n7ptLE"><strong>Beyond the Banana Piano</strong></a> (that's a Google doc: <a href="http://goo.gl/n7ptLE">http://goo.gl/n7ptLE</a>). I wrote them on index cards as prompts. He started the workshop by showing this <a href="http://youtu.be/wkPt9MYqDW0"><strong>video compilation of music examples</strong></a>, which set a playful and inventive tone. (You can also see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ericrosenbaum/sets/72157637232542583/">Flickr photos from the workshop</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't have to be music-focused, as <span class="mention">@skola2015</span> and the student project he shared demonstrates! Will be interested to hear how you're experimenting.</p>

<p>How to make a <strong>Water Sensor</strong> that works with Scratch and Makey Makey</p>

</div></a></div> </p>
<p>The sensor is made with paper clips. When a water drop hits the sensor, it creates a contact between the two sensor parts (water is electrical conductor). Connect one side to the ground and one to the SPACE (for instance). Than you have to create a prog/algorithm to detect the water and send alarm. Here is possible solution</p>

<p>You inspired me to come up with a game that can help to introduce new learners to MaKey MaKey in a short amount of time when time is limited such as in your case. This can help reduce any intimidation of a new and unfamiliar project and may make learning about MaKey MaKey and conductivity in general exciting and fun. You can see the project here:</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="http://www.makeymakey.com/forums/index.php?topic=15197.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.makeymakey.com/forums/index.php?topic=15197.0</a></p>

<p>After an initial introduction like this one, you can start to design more complex or more theme-focused projects with your learners for each new event. As <span class="mention">@skola2015</span> suggests below, some projects can take more time and blocks of time will need to be set aside just for introducing learners to Scratch and creating Scratch projects for use with MaKey. This all depends on you and your class's needs and availability. You can also just jump right into Scratch projects and other programs already compatible with your MaKey such as the Scratch project shared above.</p>
<p><em>PS <span class="mention">@eva_soderbergh</span> You can use one or more MaKey. One MaKey can be shared between 18 individuals or teams to give each individual or team control over one keyboard key or mouse movement. With less groups each group would have access to more. More MaKeys means more people and more capabilities per person (also, less mess due to wires going all over the place). Also, yes, MaKey MaKeys are entirely reusable.</em> </p>

<p>It´s ok. I really have to practise my english. Are you the only teacher interested? One hour a week isn´t enough. About 6-7 hours. + I introduced Scratch last semester about 90 min. The best way is probably to get another teacher involved (tech or science teacher, maths?)</p>
<p>Because my occupation as a ICT-pedagogical educator (IKT-pedagog) I made this together with two teachers, but I could do it alone, because the kids are awesome. I invested in 10 MakeyMakeys, 1 M. per group of 2 kids, I love the interaction between them. Reuse them, unplug the wires and go for another project.</p>
<p>I´ve seen some projects with handicraft, interactive drum T-shirt.</p>
<p>By the way, I love question, tons of them in my head....</p>

<p>I actually don't have much experience setting up Google Hangouts myself but I can try to host at least one for this Meet group. It looks like we also have a variety of time zones in here, maybe we can take turns hosting? That might give more people a chance at the helm of a hangout and more schedule flexibility.

<p>Thank you so much for the very committed answer. Since I´ve never tried anything like this it will take time to process, I think I´ll have to get me a MaKey to try myself first. Maybe I´m a bit out of line since textile craft is my subject to teach? I think I need to find a way to motivate the connection before I launch it with the kids.</p>

<p>It looks like our Daylight Savings Times might be different. It looks like you might switch to Daylight Savings Time April 6th, but I have already switched to DST in my area.</p>
<p>If we try before April 6th, that'd put us at 2:00 AM UTC/GMT which would be 8:00 PM your time. If we try for April 6th or after, let me know if 2:00 AM UTC/GMT would still work for you or if you would want a different time.</p>
<p>Let's settle on a good date, I should be free except for 3/29 (tomorrow night) or 4/1 (next Tuesday night). Anyone here will be welcome to join us, and maybe we can figure out how to schedule the next one for others' needs.</p>

<p>Hi All!<br/>I am a little late to this thread, but regardless I wanted to reach out.<br/>I'm currently developing a one input / d.i.y. derivative of the MaKey MaKey.</p>
<p>I've been working at the Free Library of Philadelphia for the past year and am doing this work/research as my thesis at the University of the Arts. (Can the library and its participants make their own low-cost/accessible learning hardware?) This formed out of a realization that my kids(participants) were not taking ownership of their tools and were clueless/curious as to how the MM worked(also see cost).</p>
<p>I haven't really let the cat fully out of the bag, but will be sharing my source code, documentation, and resources over the next few weeks if anyone is interested. I also haven't really posted anything to the MaKey MaKey forums as someone said they contribute to earlier in this tread(probably should do that as well).</p>
<p>I'd be more than happy to talk with folks here about MM projects/stuff if y'all are down for some G+Hangouts etc.</p>

<p>At our school we've tinkered around with Makey Makey at our lunchtime makerspaces and as part of European Week. The collaboration to create musical stairs and a dance mat pacman controller was amazing. Synthesizers are great fun utilizing alumni foil, conductive thread and cardboard boxed hooked up to Femur or GarageBand. I would love to change the keys, but yet to try!</p>

<p>Looking for help here. I created a P2PU course on how to reprogram the MaKey MaKey:</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2119/reprogramming-makey-makey/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://p2pu.org/en/courses/2119/reprogramming-makey-makey/</a></p>
<p>If you are new to MaKey and/or Arduino, what are your thoughts? Is it intimidating? Too confusing? Inviting? What would you change, or are there additional steps you'd like to see? Any content you would like to see covered more in-depth? Are the activities/badges appropriate, or would you change them up? How, if so?</p>
<p>If you have already reprogrammed your MaKey and/or already experienced with Arduino IDE, what are your thoughts? What would you change?</p>
<p>Does anyone here want to help me build this course? It is still a Work-In-Progress. My personal opinion is that the course should lean more towards peer-based (more than it is currently, I think).</p>
