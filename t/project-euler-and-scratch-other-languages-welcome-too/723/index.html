<p>"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."</p>

<p>So, we started this in session 2 backchannel and it is starting to grow.</p>
<p>If you are interested, we are still kicking around ideas about how this should develop.</p>
<p>PE advises not to share solutions in public that others can search for or otherwise easily find. It's a little different with Scratch since the code is not searchable due to it being a visual language, but people can still click "See Inside" and it can work against the spirit and wishes of what PE has in mind for each individual's unique creative learning process. Easy to find solutions can be unnecessarily tempting to see someone else's solution before they try their own unique way of tackling it.</p>
<p>One idea is to tackle the solutions in Scratch but not share them to to the Scratch site. Another idea that can work with that is to create Scratch projects about each problem after we tackle them that has stuff like fun historical facts, visual aides for the maths, explanations about the maths, tips, etc. We are still kicking ideas around and aside from practicing Scratch using PE problems, we do not seem to have settled on anything yet.</p>
<p>Maybe we can do a Hangout to work on PE problems together, kick ideas around, reflect about different aspects of this collab project, etc. If you are interested, follow our studio and leave a comment so we can add you as a studio manager and start looking at directions and possible Hangout times.</p>
