<p>This is a thread for any creatives out there that could use a good, old or new fashioned art challenge to get past creative blocks, let out rampant creative energy, exercise creativity just because exercise is good, or whatever other purposes may be lurking out there. I like this kind of thing. If you do, too, join in the reindeer games. Also, if you have concerns about this kind of post being in here, share your feedback!</p>
<p>There's no juried winners here, this isn't an art contest. All skill levels welcome, new art forms one has not explored very much yet are especially welcome.</p>
<p>A lot of what LCL does for me is how to change factors so that obstacles that challenge creative learning are no longer there or otherwise no longer impede. What I am calling a "creative challenge" is a different kind of challenge, a kind of challenge designed to embrace and explore for different purposes.</p>
<p>This creative challenge is pretty easy to stick to the challenge rules: <strong>Let it all hang out in this art jam thread.</strong> Post art inspired by other art in this thread, random art about shaking nervous energy out, or anything you want to contribute.</p>
<p>In most threads, the LCL Community Guidelines encourages us to stay on topic. There is a great new tool that allows you to split from a topic with a new discussion so that branches of new terrain are not discouraged. However, as long as you are helping to grow the artistic energy in this thread with your post, there's nothing off-topic so just let it all hang out (abiding ToS, obviously).</p>
<p>If you've been looking for a place to start participating but are unsure about the water temperature, dive right in here with a haiku, a photo** you've taken, a painting** you've painted, a song you've made, or any piece of art you'd like to share with us.</p>
<p>It can be art about LCL and LCL topics, or not. It can be about anything you want, as long as it is respectful to the inviting community being built.</p>
<p>Are you having trouble figuring out how to get mixed media in your posts?</p>
<p>Here's some tips (you can see these work live in the preview panel):</p>
<ul>
<li>To embed YouTube, just enter the YouTube link on a line by itself and Discourse will work it's magic.*</li>
<li>Discourse will try to embed a preview for any other URL posted on a line by itself.*</li>
<li>You can upload images with the upload button in the post editor. <ul>
<li>After uploading an image, Discourse will place HTML that looks like<br/>this somewhere in your post: <code>&lt;img src="..." width="..." height="..."&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>Yep, that means simple <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> code can link to offsite images, too. Just remember to never post content without permission if it is not yours.</li>
<li>You can copy and paste the image HTML and place it anywhere else in the body of your post. Preview will show how it looks.</li>
<li>You can also change the width and height in the HTML code. Preview will help you see how it might look full page, but there is a reasonable size limit cap.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OK then, well, I've got some crazy nervous creative energy going right now waiting for LCL to start and I gotta do something about it. So I'm going to post a drawing I sketched of a bass player wearing reindeer antlers, because there are no rules in art and seeing LCL come back is like getting a visit from Santa in March.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@James_B</span>, challenge accepted and in the same spirit as your Santa picture here's my reindeer art. I'm not so much into the art itself as I am in processes that resemble art. I've been using machinery hooked to computers for 15 years now. Even after that many years of doing this process the process of design, writing code, and watching a machine cut things is like watching an artist do his\her thing.</p>

<p>Wow! Is the model open source, by any chance?</p>
<p>That's a superb little antlered piece of art right there, my friend. You've got me thinking about how CADCode and G-Code work can be an art in its own right. One of our biggest 3D printer enthusiasts at my Makerspace seems to flourish best in G-Code and I would describe the amazing things-he-does-that-I-do-not-yet-understand as a form of art.</p>
<p>Elegant design art for CNC and I can imagine elegant CADCode art. When you create like this, you are still the artist. The automated machine is just an extension helping you to create and perform your art in a new way! Even CNC and fab machine builds/repair/mods/tweaks are in part art for this reason, in my opinion. But I may have a loose interpretation of art. Important and exciting, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Your design and a photo of finished creation work to reflect how your participation here very much involved art.</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing!</p>
<p>As an art jam can often include art inspired by and responding to other art in the jam and the art you posted deals with automated fabrication and manufacturing, here's a 3D printing haiku inspired by just that:</p>
<pre><code>"Broken Code"

Oh, my heating bed,
You are such a fragile thing;
Typo-sensitive.</code></pre>
<p>I know, I know, right? I'm a <em>cad</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="blush" class="emoji" height="64" src="../../../images/blush.png" title=":blush:" width="64"/> </p>
<p>Come on in, anyone else out there! Join us, the water is warming up nicely. You can run with our silly reindeer theme we bounced around or something else, there really is no one underlying art theme.</p>
